Actually, I did.

So now do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Are you serious?

Phoebe knows,
and she's just trying to freak us out.

That's the only explanation for it.

Okay, but what about my pinchable butt
and my bulging biceps?

But, hey, it's over now, right?

175
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,751
Because you can tell them
you know they know...

176
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,337
...and I can go back to knowing
absolutely nothing.

I wouldn't bring that up.
It would probably just bum him out.

Imagine going to school
with that in your head.

70
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:23,826
Difference between men and women?

71
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,373
I would never say something
that cruel to her.

72
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:31,320
Certainly not in front of Carl.

73
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,395
All available units, high speed
pursuit in progress

74
00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:42,508
Lincoln county units
request local assistance.

75
00:08:42,628 --> 00:08:47,058
Highway 18 south GTAAD W217 243.

76
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:48,574
Proceed with extreme caution.

77
00:09:01,188 --> 00:09:03,277
Suspects are two male Caucasians.

78
00:09:03,398 --> 00:09:05,370
Be advised, they have fired
on police officers.

79
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:07,472
One Lindon county officer is wounded.

80
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:19,809
Unit 1, Unit 3, please ***.

81
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:24,361
18, 2 miles west of lnterstate 85
and we'll patch in Lindon County Sheriff radio.

82
00:09:25,252 --> 00:09:28,726
Roger that. We're 5 minutes out
on the route 18 intersection.

83
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:33,207
Dispatch, Unit 1, Unit 3, we are 10-97
in code 100.

84
00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:35,887
Highway 18, *** Interstate, please advise.

85
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,491
***

86
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:55,924
Sounds like they're chasing those idiots
up and down every back road we got.

87
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:57,945
Hey, we'll get them on one of
those video shows, you know,

88
00:09:57,984 --> 00:10:00,012
like World's craziest police chases,
what do you think?

89
00:10:00,065 --> 00:10:02,120
What I think, Leon, is that
you need to stay focused.

90
00:10:02,412 --> 00:10:04,869
Make sure you got a round
in the chamber and your safety off.

91
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:14,509
Would be kind of cool to get on
one of them shows.

92
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,049
Holy shit.

93
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:28,112
- Gun, gun, gun.
- Put it down!

94
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:30,015
Put the gun down!

95
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:05,885
- Rick!
- I'm alright!

96
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:13,049
I saw you get tagged, man,
it scared the hell out of me.

97
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,040
Me too.

98
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:18,612
Son of a bitch shot me.
You believe that?

99
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:20,144
We'll get you a new vest.

100
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,412
Yeah.

101
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:27,363
Shane, you do not tell Lori
that happened. Ever.

102
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:29,014
You understand... Aah!

103
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:33,931
Rick! Rick!
No, no, no!

104
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,105
Shh, shh, shh.

105
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:38,498
No, no, no, no...

106
00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:39,654
He's hurt!

107
00:12:40,157 --> 00:12:41,283
***

108
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:44,982
You get that ambulance down here, you tell
them there's an officer down, you do it now!

109
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:49,706
Shh, shh, shh, hey, you look at me,
stay with me, you hear me? Shh, shh. okay.

110
00:12:49,972 --> 00:12:53,681
Shh, shh, stay with me, you hear me?

111
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:54,743
Shh, shh, ok?

112
00:12:54,863 --> 00:12:56,573
You stay with me, ok?

113
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:15,049
Hey, bud...

114
00:13:16,892 --> 00:13:18,380
We're still here.

115
00:13:19,309 --> 00:13:20,836
We're still hanging in.

116
00:13:25,257 --> 00:13:26,549
Look, I'm sorry, man.

117
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:29,157
I'm mean watching the same crap
every time I come in here.

118
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:35,900
Everybody pitched in on these. They uh...

119
00:13:36,664 --> 00:13:38,914
They wanted me to bring them down,
they send their love and they just...

120
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,373
They hope you come back real soon.

121
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:48,342
Linda and Diane from dispatch,
they picked these out.

122
00:13:49,573 --> 00:13:50,649
You probably could tell, hmm?

123
00:13:53,585 --> 00:13:55,703
I'll just set this on your side table, ok?

124
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:08,502
That vase has something special.

125
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:12,250
Fess up. Did you steal it from
your Grandma Gene's house.

126
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,713
I hope you left her that spoon collection.

127
00:14:24,326 --> 00:14:25,329
Shane?

128
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:31,480
Shane, you in the john?

129
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,850
Nurse, help.

130
00:15:52,924 --> 00:15:53,993
Nurse.

131
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:55,524
Help!

132
00:23:44,368 --> 00:23:45,706
Lori!

133
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:49,849
Lori!

134
00:23:57,034 --> 00:23:58,386
Carl!

135
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:00,243
Carl!

136
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:09,101
Lori! Carl!

137
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:26,368
Lori! Carl!

138
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:46,484
Is this real?
Am I here?

139
00:24:53,437 --> 00:24:55,057
Wake, wake up!

140
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,012
- Daddy, daddy!
- Carl...

141
00:26:12,262 --> 00:26:13,211
Carl?

142
00:26:13,774 --> 00:26:14,704
I found you...

143
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,072
Daddy, I got this sumbitch.
I'm gonna smack him dead.

144
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,278
He say something?
I thought I heard him say something.

145
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,971
- He called me Carl.
- Son, you know they don't talk.

146
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:30,999
Hey, mister!

147
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,166
What's that bandage for?

148
00:26:35,313 --> 00:26:37,172
- What?
- What kind of wound?

149
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:40,282
You answer me, damn you!

150
00:26:41,247 --> 00:26:42,371
What's your wound?

151
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:45,197
You tell me!

152
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,433
Or I will kill you.

153
00:27:11,992 --> 00:27:15,398
Got that bandage changed out.
It was pretty rank.

154
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:19,026
What was? The wound?

155
00:27:20,295 --> 00:27:22,414
- Gun shot.
- Gun shot?

156
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,333
What else? Anything?

157
00:27:26,607 --> 00:27:28,003
Gun shot ain't enough?

158
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:32,316
Look, I ask and you answer,

159
00:27:32,796 --> 00:27:34,483
It's common courtesy, right?

160
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:40,777
Did you get bit?

161
00:27:43,091 --> 00:27:44,798
- Bit?
- Bit. Chewed.

162
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,426
Maybe scratch? Anything like that.

163
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:49,930
No, I got shot.

164
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:53,072
- Just shot?
- As far as I know.

165
00:27:56,747 --> 00:27:57,612
Hey...

166
00:27:58,018 --> 00:27:58,877
Just let me...

167
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:03,919
Feels cooler now.

168
00:28:04,804 --> 00:28:06,501
Fever would have killed you by now.

169
00:28:07,628 --> 00:28:10,250
- I don't think I have one.
- Be hard to miss.

170
00:28:16,785 --> 00:28:17,829
Take a moment, eh?

171
00:28:18,158 --> 00:28:19,396
Look how sharp it is.

172
00:28:20,435 --> 00:28:22,274
You try anything...

173
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:25,779
I will kill you with it,
and don't you think I won't.

174
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:38,993
Come on up when you're able.

175
00:28:43,011 --> 00:28:43,707
Come on.

176
00:29:15,723 --> 00:29:16,890
This place...

177
00:29:18,594 --> 00:29:20,026
It's Fred and Cindy Drake's.

178
00:29:20,944 --> 00:29:22,162
Never met them.

179
00:29:22,872 --> 00:29:25,139
I've been here. This is their place

180
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:27,506
It was empty when we got here.

181
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:31,957
Don't do that.

182
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:33,845
They'll see the light.

183
00:29:34,664 --> 00:29:36,209
There's more of them out there than usual.

184
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,924
I never should have fired that gun today.

185
00:29:40,773 --> 00:29:43,305
The sound draws them,
now they're all over the street.

186
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:47,165
Stupid... using a gun...

187
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:50,114
It all happened so fast...

188
00:29:51,052 --> 00:29:53,863
- I didn't think.
- You shot that man today.

189
00:29:54,762 --> 00:29:55,532
Man?

190
00:29:55,952 --> 00:29:58,657
- No man... - What the hell was that
out of your mouth just now?

191
00:29:59,726 --> 00:30:01,610
- It wasn't a man.
- You shot him.

192
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,560
In this street, out front, a man.

193
00:30:03,598 --> 00:30:05,879
For him, you need glasses,
that was a walker.

194
00:30:06,904 --> 00:30:07,564
Come on.

195
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:11,315
Sit down, before you fall down.

196
00:30:13,026 --> 00:30:14,623
Here. Eat.

197
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,119
Daddy...

198
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:20,285
Blessing...

199
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,331
Yeah.

200
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:38,717
Father, we thank thee for this food...

201
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,125
Thy blessings...

202
00:30:41,115 --> 00:30:44,119
We ask you to watch over us in these crazy days.

203
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,260
- Amen.
- Amen.

204
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:54,361
Hey, mister, do you even know
what is going on?

205
00:30:54,814 --> 00:30:56,302
I woke up today.

206
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,888
In a hospital.

207
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:02,487
Came home, that's all I know.

208
00:31:06,557 --> 00:31:09,336
- But you know about the dead people, right?
- Yeah, I saw a lot of that.

209
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,996
Out on the loading dock, hauling trucks.

210
00:31:13,116 --> 00:31:14,035
No...

211
00:31:14,515 --> 00:31:15,775
Not the one's they put down...

212
00:31:16,054 --> 00:31:18,017
The one's they didn't. The walkers.

213
00:31:19,405 --> 00:31:20,924
Like the one I shot today.

214
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:22,942
Cause he would have ripped into you.

215
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:25,787
Try to eat you, take him
some flesh at least.

216
00:31:27,229 --> 00:31:29,419
But I guess if this is the first
you're hearing,

217
00:31:30,045 --> 00:31:31,653
I know how it must sound...

218
00:31:35,114 --> 00:31:37,363
- They're out there now, in the street?
- Yeah.

219
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:40,723
They're even more active
after dark sometimes.

220
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:42,851
Maybe it's the cool air or...

221
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:45,304
Hell, maybe it's just me
firing up that gun today.

222
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:48,605
But we'll be fine long as we stay quiet.

223
00:31:49,193 --> 00:31:51,002
Probably wander off by morning.

224
00:31:53,566 --> 00:31:54,594
Well, listen...

225
00:31:56,298 --> 00:31:57,730
One thing I do know...

226
00:31:58,777 --> 00:31:59,946
Don't you get bit!

227
00:32:00,646 --> 00:32:03,234
We saw your bandage
and that's why we were afraid of.

228
00:32:04,553 --> 00:32:05,978
Bites kill you.

229
00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:07,998
The fever... burns you out.

230
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,642
But then after a while...

231
00:32:11,962 --> 00:32:12,847
You come back.

232
00:32:19,116 --> 00:32:20,316
Seen it happen...

233
00:32:26,036 --> 00:32:27,146
Come on...

234
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:36,492
Carl...

235
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,958
He your son?

236
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:40,816
William..

237
00:32:42,014 --> 00:32:43,326
He said his name today...

238
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,374
He's a little younger...

239
00:32:46,877 --> 00:32:47,865
than your boy.

240
00:32:48,543 --> 00:32:49,651
And he's with his mother?

241
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:53,087
I hope so.

242
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,160
- Dad?
- Yeah?

243
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,107
Did you ask him?

244
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,659
Your gun shot...

245
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:07,186
We got a little bet going.
My boy say you're a...

246
00:33:07,716 --> 00:33:09,321
bank robber...

247
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:11,969
Yeah...

248
00:33:12,754 --> 00:33:16,490
That's me. Deadly as Dillinger.
Kapow.

249
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:18,838
Sheriff's deputy.

250
00:33:20,648 --> 00:33:21,433
Aha.

251
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:27,141
Hey, it's ok, daddy's here.

252
00:33:27,436 --> 00:33:28,513
It's nothing.

253
00:33:29,363 --> 00:33:32,047
One of them must've bumped a car...

254
00:33:32,441 --> 00:33:35,544
- You sure?
- Happened once before.

255
00:33:36,689 --> 00:33:38,423
Went off a few minutes.

256
00:33:40,547 --> 00:33:42,024
Get the light, Dwayne.

257
00:33:56,276 --> 00:33:58,201
It's the blue one, down the street.

258
00:33:58,889 --> 00:34:00,496
Same one as last time.

259
00:34:01,135 --> 00:34:02,613
I think we're ok.

260
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,006
That noise...

261
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,814
Will it bring more of them?

262
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:10,976
Nothing to do about it now.

263
00:34:12,371 --> 00:34:13,966
Just have to wait 'em out till morning.

264
00:34:19,006 --> 00:34:20,006
She's here.

265
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:23,207
Don't look.
Get away from the windows.

266
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,776
I said go! Come on!

267
00:34:34,868 --> 00:34:36,717
Come on, quiet.

268
00:34:37,288 --> 00:34:39,820
Shh, shh...

269
00:34:58,923 --> 00:35:02,114
It's ok, here. Cry into the pillow.

270
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:03,449
Can you remember?

271
00:35:03,846 --> 00:35:05,403
Shh...

272
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:44,800
She, uh...

273
00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:50,445
She died in the other room, on that bed...

274
00:35:52,898 --> 00:35:55,882
Nothin' I can do about it here...

275
00:35:56,463 --> 00:35:57,841
That fever, man...

276
00:35:59,406 --> 00:36:01,647
Her skin gave off heat like a furnace...

277
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:12,570
Should have put her down, I should
have put her down, I know that, but...

278
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:15,852
You know what...

279
00:36:16,129 --> 00:36:17,686
I just didn't have it in me...

280
00:36:22,136 --> 00:36:24,402
She's the mother of my child.

281
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:52,539
- You sure?
- They're dead.

282
00:36:53,236 --> 00:36:55,658
They have to ask, at least one more time.

283
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,727
They're dead.
Except for something in the brain.

284
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:01,890
That's why it's gotta be the head.

285
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:28,015
You alright?

286
00:37:30,023 --> 00:37:31,151
Need a moment?

287
00:37:37,103 --> 00:37:38,270
They're alive.

288
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:39,947
My wife and son.

289
00:37:40,418 --> 00:37:41,944
At least they were when they left.

290
00:37:42,065 --> 00:37:43,433
How can you know?

291
00:37:44,402 --> 00:37:47,663
- By the look of this place...
- I found empty drawers in the bedroom.

292
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:49,942
They packed some clothes. Not a lot.

293
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:51,420
But enough to travel.

294
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:54,901
You know anybody could've broken in here
and stolen clothes, right?

295
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,631
You see the framed photos on the walls?

296
00:37:59,299 --> 00:38:02,461
Neither do I. Some random thief
took those too, you think?

297
00:38:06,678 --> 00:38:09,582
My photo albums, family pictures, all gone.

298
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:12,510
Photo albums...

299
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,619
My wife...

300
00:38:20,747 --> 00:38:21,855
Same thing...

301
00:38:23,114 --> 00:38:27,149
Here I am, packing survival gear,
she's grabbing photo albums....

302
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,597
They're in Atlanta, I'll bet.

303
00:38:34,577 --> 00:38:35,754
That's right.

304
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,557
- Why there?
- Refugee settle.

305
00:38:39,594 --> 00:38:41,951
Huge, when they said it,
before the broadcast stopped.

306
00:38:42,824 --> 00:38:45,455
Military protection, food, shelter...

307
00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:47,556
They told people to go there.

308
00:38:48,134 --> 00:38:49,314
Said to be safest.

309
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,437
Plus they got that disease place.

310
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:53,282
Center for Disease Control.

311
00:38:53,612 --> 00:38:56,424
Said they were working on
how to solve this thing.

312
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,521
Gas and light have been down
for maybe a month.

313
00:39:26,979 --> 00:39:29,017
Station got its own propane system.

314
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,239
Pilot's still on.

315
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:38,217
Oh, my Lord.

316
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:40,104
Hot water!

317
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:42,384
- Whoo!
- That feels good, right?

318
00:39:53,338 --> 00:39:54,217
Dwayne...

319
00:39:55,707 --> 00:39:57,124
Dress in room back there.

320
00:39:58,222 --> 00:39:59,455
What you say, Dwayne?

321
00:40:00,418 --> 00:40:01,356
Thank you.

322
00:40:02,675 --> 00:40:03,793
Mhm.

323
00:40:07,267 --> 00:40:08,835
Atlanta sounds like a good deal.

324
00:40:09,926 --> 00:40:11,598
Safer anyway. People...

325
00:40:13,168 --> 00:40:14,357
That's where we were heading.

326
00:40:15,453 --> 00:40:18,137
Things got crazy. Man, you won't believe.

327
00:40:18,257 --> 00:40:19,151
The panic...

328
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:21,816
Streets won't fit to be on,
and then we'll...

329
00:40:23,993 --> 00:40:25,041
My wife...

330
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,742
couldn't travel. no, not with our herd,

331
00:40:27,862 --> 00:40:29,502
so we had to find a place to lay low.

332
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:31,837
And then, after she died...

333
00:40:35,022 --> 00:40:36,505
We just stayed hunkered down.

334
00:40:39,442 --> 00:40:41,266
I guess we just froze in place.

335
00:40:43,201 --> 00:40:44,442
Plan to move on?

336
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,109
Haven't worked up to it yet. (*)

337
00:40:58,711 --> 00:41:00,230
A lot of it's gone missing.

338
00:41:01,647 --> 00:41:03,158
Dad, can I learn to shoot?

339
00:41:03,279 --> 00:41:04,743
I'm old enough.

340
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:06,212
Hell yes you're going to learn.

341
00:41:06,332 --> 00:41:08,689
We gotta do it carefully, teach you
to respect the weapon.

342
00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:10,613
That's right. It's not a toy.

343
00:41:10,962 --> 00:41:14,195
You pull the trigger, you have to mean it.
Always remember that, Dwayne.

344
00:41:14,315 --> 00:41:15,247
Yes, sir.

345
00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:18,678
Here.

346
00:41:20,362 --> 00:41:21,325
Go on.

347
00:41:26,682 --> 00:41:28,032
Take that one.

348
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,357
Nothing fancy.

349
00:41:29,831 --> 00:41:31,272
Scope's accurate.

350
00:41:44,143 --> 00:41:49,159
Conserve your ammo. Goes faster than
you think. Especially at target practice.

351
00:41:50,692 --> 00:41:51,571
Dwayne.

352
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:53,636
- Yeah?
- Take this to the car.

353
00:41:55,226 --> 00:41:56,684
You sure you won't come along?

354
00:41:57,655 --> 00:41:58,870
A few more days...

355
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,238
By the end, Dwayne will know how
to shoot and I won't be so rusty.

356
00:42:09,816 --> 00:42:11,044
You got one better.

357
00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:14,375
I'll turn mine on, a few minutes
every day at dawn.

358
00:42:14,494 --> 00:42:16,946
You get up there, that's how you find me.

359
00:42:17,607 --> 00:42:19,929
- You think they're here?
- Can't afford not to.

360
00:42:20,242 --> 00:42:22,953
- Not anymore.
- Look, just one thing.

361
00:42:23,384 --> 00:42:25,349
They may not seem
like much one at a time...

362
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,764
but in a group all round up and hungry...

363
00:42:28,385 --> 00:42:30,793
- They you watch your ass.
- You too.

364
00:42:33,336 --> 00:42:34,397
You a good man, Rick.

365
00:42:35,007 --> 00:42:36,515
I hope you find your wife and son.

366
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,598
Be seeing you, Dwayne.

367
00:42:41,587 --> 00:42:43,604
- Take care of your old man.
- Yes, sir.

368
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:56,536
Leon Bessi?

369
00:43:00,652 --> 00:43:02,016
Didn't think much of him.

370
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,056
Careless and dumb, but...

371
00:43:04,956 --> 00:43:07,098
can't leave him like this.

372
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:12,231
You know, if they hear the shot..?

373
00:43:12,662 --> 00:43:15,514
- Let's not be here when they show up.
- Let's go, son.

374
00:43:15,986 --> 00:43:16,865
Come on.

375
00:44:50,136 --> 00:44:51,872
Read your comic books a while.

376
00:44:52,327 --> 00:44:53,721
Daddy'll be upstairs.

377
00:46:55,777 --> 00:46:57,961
- Daddy?
- It's alright, Dwayne.

378
00:46:58,507 --> 00:47:00,768
You stay there, son.
Don't come up here.

379
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:31,514
Come on, baby.

380
00:48:02,383 --> 00:48:05,178
I'm sorry this happened to you.

381
00:48:59,462 --> 00:49:01,173
Come on, come on.

382
00:49:55,698 --> 00:49:57,522
Broadcasting on emergency channel.

383
00:49:57,642 --> 00:50:00,231
We'll be approaching Atlanta on Highway 85.

384
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,439
Anybody reads, please respond.

385
00:50:05,466 --> 00:50:07,499
Hello. Hello.

386
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,257
Can anybody hear my voice?

387
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:15,536
Anybody out there?
Anybody hears me, please respond.

388
00:50:17,805 --> 00:50:19,464
Hello, can you hear my voice?

389
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:22,658
Hello? Hello? Can anybody hear my voice?

390
00:50:24,366 --> 00:50:25,265
Hey? Hello?

391
00:50:25,759 --> 00:50:27,405
- Can you hear my voice?
- Yes, I can hear you.

392
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:28,761
You're coming through. Over.

393
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,600

00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:44,202
We're just outside the city.

398
00:50:45,114 --> 00:50:46,033
Damnit.

399
00:50:46,702 --> 00:50:47,661
Hello?

400
00:50:48,251 --> 00:50:49,177
Hello?

401
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:51,251
He couldn't hear me. I couldn't warn him.

402
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:52,292
Try to raise him again.

403
00:50:52,627 --> 00:50:54,704
Come on, son. You know best
how to work this thing,

404
00:50:57,685 --> 00:51:00,169
Hello, hello, is the person
who calls still on the air?

405
00:51:03,467 --> 00:51:07,295
This is officer Shane Walsh, broadcasting
a person unknown, please respond.

406
00:51:13,921 --> 00:51:14,963
He's gone.

407
00:51:17,258 --> 00:51:19,362
There are others. It's not just us.

408
00:51:19,667 --> 00:51:22,022
Yeah, We knew there would be, right,
that's why we let the CB on.

409
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:24,276
Lot of good it's been doing.

410
00:51:24,984 --> 00:51:27,478
And I've been saying for a week,
we ought to put signs up on 85

411
00:51:27,524 --> 00:51:28,970
to warn people away from the city.

412
00:51:29,392 --> 00:51:31,368
Folks got no idea
what they're getting into.

413
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:33,318
We don't have enough time.

414
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:36,382
I think we need to make time.

415
00:51:36,777 --> 00:51:38,305
Yeah, that, uh...

416
00:51:38,923 --> 00:51:40,408
That's a luxury we can't afford.

417
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:43,244
We are surviving here.
We are day to day.

418
00:51:44,445 --> 00:51:46,256
And who the hell would you propose to send?

419
00:51:46,376 --> 00:51:48,193
I'll go. Give me a vehicle.

420
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:50,284
Nobody goes anywhere alone, you know that.

421
00:51:55,476 --> 00:51:56,886
Yes, sir.

422
00:51:57,424 --> 00:52:00,817
Hey, hey, hey, come on, take a sit, buddy.
You're alright, go on, you're alright.

423
00:52:05,303 --> 00:52:06,401
What, you're pissed at me?

424
00:52:09,317 --> 00:52:11,494
Well pissing me all you want
won't gonna change anything.

425
00:52:13,821 --> 00:52:16,868
I'm not putting you in danger, okay?
I'm not doing it for anything.

426
00:52:17,332 --> 00:52:20,784
I make you feel like sometimes you wanna
slap me outside the head...

427
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:23,507
I'll tell you what, girl. You feel that need,
you go right ahead. I'm right here.

428
00:52:26,984 --> 00:52:29,314
You cannot walk off like that,

429
00:52:29,555 --> 00:52:31,379
all half-cocked.

430
00:52:31,835 --> 00:52:34,632
Look, if you don't wanna do it for
my sake or for your sake, that's fine.

431
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:35,569
But just...

432
00:52:36,512 --> 00:52:37,575
You do it for him.

433
00:52:39,095 --> 00:52:40,754
That boy has been through too much.

434
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,636
And he's not losing his mother too, ok?

435
00:52:44,835 --> 00:52:45,694
Okay.

436
00:52:47,151 --> 00:52:48,107
Ok, fine.

437
00:52:51,988 --> 00:52:53,102
You tell me okay.

438
00:53:00,501 --> 00:53:01,589
It's not hard.

439
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:06,443
Hey...

440
00:53:20,995 --> 00:53:22,400
Mom?

441
00:53:26,212 --> 00:53:28,011
What's up, buddy? She's in there, go on.

442
00:53:29,899 --> 00:53:30,898
Hey.

443
00:53:31,507 --> 00:53:34,002
I don't want you to worry.
Your mom is not going anywhere.

444
00:53:34,123 --> 00:53:35,066
Okay?

445
00:53:35,852 --> 00:53:39,259
- Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Go finish your chores.
- Okay.

446
00:54:23,377 --> 00:54:24,346
Hello?

447
00:54:26,533 --> 00:54:28,204
Police officer out here.

448
00:54:30,951 --> 00:54:32,256
Can I borrow some gas?

449
00:54:41,491 --> 00:54:42,528
Hello?

450
00:54:48,449 --> 00:54:49,399
Hello?

451
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:51,656
Anybody home?

452
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:39,850
Easy now, easy.

453
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:41,461
I'm not gonna hurt you.

454
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,608
Nothing like that.

455
00:56:46,144 --> 00:56:47,571
More like a proposal.

456
00:56:49,579 --> 00:56:51,027
Atlanta's just down the road ways.

457
00:56:51,147 --> 00:56:52,207
It's safe there.

458
00:56:52,641 --> 00:56:56,971
Food, shelter, people,
other horses too, I bet.

459
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:00,113
How's that sound?

460
00:57:01,557 --> 00:57:03,292
There we go. Good boy.

461
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:09,384
Good boy. Now come with me.
Come with me.

462
00:57:21,042 --> 00:57:24,846
Let's go easy, ok?
I haven't done this for years.

463
00:57:30,085 --> 00:57:35,626
Easy. Easy, boy. Easy, easy, easy.

464
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:55,316
Let's go.

465
00:59:47,941 --> 00:59:51,207
Steady. It's just a few.
Nothing we can't outrun.

466
01:00:01,482 --> 01:00:03,159
Okay, whoa whoa whoa.

467
01:02:42,138 --> 01:02:44,798
Lori, Carl, I'm sorry.

468
01:05:09,008 --> 01:05:10,269
Hey, you.

469
01:05:12,567 --> 01:05:13,555
Dumb ass.

470
01:05:16,155 --> 01:05:17,329
Hey, you in the tank.

471
01:05:18,213 --> 01:05:19,247
Cozy in there?

﻿1
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:53,019
13 meters. You should see it.

2
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,051
Okay, take her up and over the bow rail.

3
00:02:09,498 --> 00:02:12,699
Okay, Mir-2, we're going over the bow.
Stay with us.

4
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:47,572
Okay, quiet. We're rolling.

5
00:02:48,216 --> 00:02:51,577
Seeing her coming out of the darkness
like a ghost ship ...

6
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:53,572
still gets me every time.

7
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:57,929
To see the sad ruin of the great ship,
sitting here ...

8
00:02:58,744 --> 00:03:03,098
where she landed at 2:30 in the morning
of April 15, 1912 ...

9
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:05,378
after her long fall ...

10
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,939
from the world above.

11
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,657
You're so full of shit, boss.

12
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,569
Dive 6.

13
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,492
Here we are again on the deck of Titanic.

14
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:45,490
2½ miles down.

15
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,169
3,821 meters.

16
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:53,048
The pressure outside
is 3½ tons per square inch.

17
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,858
These windows are 9 inches thick
and if they go ...

18
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:58,248
it's sayonara in 2 microseconds.

19
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:01,368
All right, enough of that bullshit.

20
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:17,889
Just put her down on the roof
of the officers' quarters like yesterday.

21
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:18,967
Sure.

22
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:22,136
Okay, Mir-2, we're landing
right over the Grand Staircase.

23
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:24,015
You guys set to launch?

24
00:04:24,218 --> 00:04:27,051
Yeah, Brock, launching Dunkin now.
Go, Charlie.

25
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:36,934
- All right, tether out.
- Tether out.

26
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:40,256
Okay, Brock,
we're dropping down along the hull.

27
00:04:42,818 --> 00:04:46,969
Yeah, roger that. Okay, drop down,
and go into the first-class gangway door.

28
00:04:47,057 --> 00:04:51,255
I want you guys working the "D" deck
reception area and the dining saloon.

29
00:04:51,897 --> 00:04:53,171
Copy that.

30
00:04:58,777 --> 00:04:59,892
- Tether out.
- Tether out.

31
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:02,013
Okay, now left. Now left. Left, left.

32
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:13,933
Snoop Dog is on the move.
We're headed down the stairwell.

33
00:05:16,977 --> 00:05:18,968
Okay, Lewis, drop down to "B" deck.

34
00:05:19,096 --> 00:05:20,245
"A" deck.

35
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:23,010
- Give me some rope, Captain.
- "B" deck. Get in there.

36
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:03,692
- Watch the door frame. Watch it.
- I see it. I got it.

37
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:11,409
We're good. Just chill, boss.

38
00:06:24,654 --> 00:06:26,372
Okay, make your turn.

39
00:06:27,214 --> 00:06:29,603
- Cable out, Captain.
- Make your turn. Watch the wall.

40
00:06:29,694 --> 00:06:32,083
Brock, we're at the piano. You copy?

41
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:33,722
Copy that.

42
00:06:41,454 --> 00:06:42,728
Right there.

43
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:45,772
- That's it. That's the bedroom door.
- I see it.

44
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:58,045
We're in. We're in, baby. We're there.

45
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:03,849
That's Hockley's bed.
That's where the son of a bitch slept.

46
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:11,768
Oops. Somebody left the water running.

47
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:14,651
Hold it. Just a second.
Go back to the right.

48
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,968
That wardrobe door. Get closer.

49
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,730
- You're smelling something, boss.
- I want to see what's under it.

50
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:28,609
Give me my hands, man.

51
00:07:33,612 --> 00:07:34,840
All right.

52
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:38,845
- Take it easy. It might come apart.
- Okay.

53
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:43,402
Okay, go. Flip it over. Go. Turn over.

54
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:45,125
Keep going. Go.

55
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:47,451
Okay, drop it.

56
00:07:56,051 --> 00:07:58,565
Oh, baby. Are you seeing this, boss?

57
00:08:02,011 --> 00:08:03,603
It's payday, boys.

58
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,205
Cha-ching!

59
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:23,959
- We did it, Bobby.
- We brought it back.

60
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:25,405
Oh, yeah! You the man!

61
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:28,562
Who's the best, baby? Say it.

62
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,369
You are, Lewis.

63
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,966
- Bobby, my cigar.
- Right here.

64
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,129
Okay, crack her open.

65
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,685
Let me get around. Hang on.

66
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,044
- You getting it?
- Got it.

67
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:13,398
Shit.

68
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:16,723
No diamond.

69
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:20,199
You know, boss,
this same thing happened to Geraldo ...

70
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:21,847
and his career never recovered.

71
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:27,962
Turn the camera off.

72
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:31,166
Brock. The partners would like to know
how it's going.

73
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:35,039
Hey, Dave. Barry, hi.
Look, it wasn't in the safe.

74
00:09:35,128 --> 00:09:38,518
Don't worry about it. There are
still plenty of places it could be.

75
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:39,597
Hell, yes.

76
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:42,043
The floor debris in the suite,
the mother's room ...

77
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:44,483
- The purser's safe on "C" deck.
- Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.

78
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:45,762
A dozen other places.

79
00:09:45,848 --> 00:09:49,079
Guys, look, you just got to trust
my instincts. I know we're close.

80
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:52,399
We just got to go through
a little process of elimination.

81
00:09:53,088 --> 00:09:54,646
Hang on a second.

82
00:09:57,688 --> 00:10:00,964
- Let me see that.
- We might have something here, guys.

83
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:06,204
- Where's the photograph of the necklace?
- We'll call you right back.

84
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,080
I'll be goddamned.

85
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:24,764
Treasure hunter Brock Lovett
is best known for finding Spanish gold.

86
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:27,315
It's okay, I'll feed you in a minute.

87
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:31,036
He has chartered Russian subs to reach
the most famous shipwreck of all ...

88
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:32,446
the Titanic.

89
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:36,042
He's with us live via satellite,
from the research ship Keldysh ...

90
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:37,401
in the North Atlantic.

91
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:39,523
- Hello, Brock.
- Hello, Tracy.

92
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,525
Of course, everyone knows
the familiar stories of Titanic.

93
00:10:42,606 --> 00:10:45,996
You know, the nobility of the band
playing to the very end and all that.

94
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:48,441
But what I'm interested in
are the untold stories ...

95
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:51,040
the secrets locked deep inside
the hull of Titanic.

96
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:54,323
And we're out here using robot technology
to go further into the wreck ...

97
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:56,158
than anybody has ever done before.

98
00:10:56,246 --> 00:10:58,396
Your expedition is at the center
of a storm ...

99
00:10:58,486 --> 00:11:01,364
of controversy over salvage rights,
and even ethics.

100
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:03,198
Many are calling you a grave-robber.

101
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:06,403
Nobody ever called the recovery
of the artifacts from King Tut's tomb ...

102
00:11:06,486 --> 00:11:08,556
- What is it?
- Turn that up, dear.

103
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:11,319
I have museum-trained experts
sent out here making sure ...

104
00:11:11,406 --> 00:11:14,238
that these relics are preserved
and catalogued properly.

105
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:17,158
Take a look at this drawing
that we found just today.

106
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:20,442
A piece of paper that's been underwater
for 84 years ...

107
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:23,403
and my team are able to preserve it intact.

108
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,959
Should this have remained unseen
at the bottom of the ocean for eternity?

109
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,478
We can see it and ...

110
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,157
I'll be goddamned.

111
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:37,323
Brock, there's a satellite call for you.

112
00:11:37,724 --> 00:11:40,956
Bobby, we're launching. See these
submersibles going in the water?

113
00:11:41,044 --> 00:11:43,798
Trust me, buddy,
you want to take this call.

114
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,522
This better be good.

115
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:50,235
- You got to speak up. She's kind of old.
- Great.

116
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:54,953
This is Brock Lovett.
How can I help you, Mrs. ...

117
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:56,796
Calvert. Rose Calvert.

118
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:58,517
Mrs. Calvert?

119
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:04,114
I was just wondering if you had found
the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett.

120
00:12:06,484 --> 00:12:08,839
Told you you wanted to take the call.

121
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:12,797
All right, you have my attention, Rose.

122
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:16,075
Can you tell us who the woman
in the picture is?

123
00:12:16,163 --> 00:12:18,757
Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.

124
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,638
She's a goddamn liar!
Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.

125
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:42,958
God only knows why!
Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.

126
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:44,635
They're inbound!

127
00:12:49,722 --> 00:12:53,431
Rose Dewitt Bukater died on the Titanic
when she was 17, right?

128
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,637
That's right.

129
00:12:54,722 --> 00:12:57,236
If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.

130
00:12:57,322 --> 00:12:59,438
101 next month.

131
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:02,315
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.

132
00:13:02,602 --> 00:13:04,957
Look, I've already done the background
on this woman ...

133
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:08,751
all the way back to the '20s,
when she was working as an actress.

134
00:13:08,842 --> 00:13:11,720
An actress.
There's your first clue, Sherlock.

135
00:13:11,962 --> 00:13:16,239
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.
Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

136
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:19,758
They move to Cedar Rapids
and she punches out a couple of kids.

137
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,799
Now Calvert's dead, and from what I hear,
Cedar Rapids is dead.

138
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:24,519
And everybody
who knows about the diamond ...

139
00:13:24,601 --> 00:13:27,479
is supposed to be dead or on this boat,
but she knows.

140
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:42,835
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?

141
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:44,639
Hurry up, give him a hand!

142
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:48,277
Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.
Welcome to the Keldysh.

143
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:51,792
Okay, let's get her inside there.

144
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,632
- Hi, Miss Calvert.
- Hi.

145
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,518
- Welcome to the Keldysh.
- Thanks.

146
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,349
Yes?

147
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,637
- Are your staterooms all right?
- Oh, yes, very nice.

148
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,635
Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy?
She takes care of me.

149
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,757
We met just a few minutes ago.
Remember, Nana, up on deck?

150
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,915
Oh, yeah ...

151
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,152
There. That's nice.
Have to have my pictures when I travel.

152
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,996
Can I get you anything?
Is there anything you'd like?

153
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:31,354
Yes.

154
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,034
I would like to see my drawing.

155
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,757
Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone
called the Blue Diamond of the Crown.

156
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,228
It disappeared in 1792.

157
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,792
About the same time old Louis
lost everything from the neck up.

158
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:02,468
The theory goes that the 
crown diamond was chopped, too.

159
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:06,950
Re-cut into a heart-like shape that 
became known as the "Heart of the Ocean".

160
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:10,030
Today, it would be worth
more than the Hope Diamond.

161
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:14,316
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.
I only wore it this once.

162
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:16,946
You actually think this is you, Nana?

163
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:18,557
It is me, dear.

164
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,876
Wasn't I a dish?

165
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:25,396
I tracked it down
through insurance records.

166
00:15:25,477 --> 00:15:29,152
An old claim that was settled
under terms of absolute secrecy.

167
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:32,876
Can you tell me
who the claimant was, Rose?

168
00:15:33,157 --> 00:15:35,751
I should imagine someone named Hockley.

169
00:15:36,077 --> 00:15:39,308
Nathan Hockley. That's right.
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

170
00:15:40,117 --> 00:15:44,668
The claim was for a diamond necklace
his son, Caledon, bought his fiancée, you.

171
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:47,906
A week before he sailed on Titanic.

172
00:15:48,757 --> 00:15:51,271
It was filed right after the sinking.

173
00:15:51,797 --> 00:15:54,947
So the diamond had to have gone down
with the ship.

174
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:57,596
You see the date?

175
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:00,594
April 14, 1912.

176
00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:03,475
Which means if your grandmother
is who she says she is ...

177
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:06,753
she was wearing the diamond
the day the Titanic sank.

178
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:09,396
And that makes you my new best friend.

179
00:16:10,516 --> 00:16:13,826
These are some of the things
we recovered from your stateroom.

180
00:16:16,036 --> 00:16:17,435
This was mine.

181
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,474
How extraordinary!

182
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:24,872
And it looks the same as it did
the last time I saw it.

183
00:16:30,316 --> 00:16:32,545
The reflection has changed a bit.

184
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:51,104
Are you ready to go back to Titanic?

185
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,824
Here we go.
She hits the 'berg on the starboard side.

186
00:16:58,355 --> 00:17:02,950
She kind of bumps along, punching holes
like Morse code along the side ...

187
00:17:03,034 --> 00:17:04,547
below the water line.

188
00:17:04,634 --> 00:17:06,704
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.

189
00:17:06,794 --> 00:17:10,628
Now, as the water level rises,
it spills over the watertight bulkheads ...

190
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:13,751
which, unfortunately,
don't go any higher than "E" deck.

191
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:17,986
So now, as the bow goes down,
the stern rises up, slow at first ...

192
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:22,465
then faster and faster, until finally,
she's got her whole ass sticking in the air.

193
00:17:22,554 --> 00:17:25,944
And that's a big ass.
We're talking 20,000, 30,000 tons.

194
00:17:26,314 --> 00:17:28,874
Okay? And the hull's not designed to deal
with that pressure.

195
00:17:28,954 --> 00:17:32,469
So what happens?
She splits, right down to the keel ...

196
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:35,069
and the stern falls back level.

197
00:17:35,714 --> 00:17:40,389
Then as the bow sinks, it pulls the stern
vertical and then finally detaches.

198
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:45,665
Now the stern section kind of bobs there
like a cork for a couple of minutes ...

199
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:48,347
floods, and finally goes under
about 2:20 am ...

200
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:51,231
2 hours and 40 minutes
after the collision.

201
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:55,952
The bow section planes away,
landing about a ½ a mile away ...

202
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,945
going 20, 30 knots
when it hits the ocean floor.

203
00:18:02,392 --> 00:18:03,745
Pretty cool, huh?

204
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:07,620
Thank you for that fine 
forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.

205
00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:11,421
Of course, 
the experience of it was —

206
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:14,503
somewhat different.

207
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:17,143
Will you share it with us?

208
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,661
- I'm taking her to rest.
- No.

209
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,667
- Come on, Nana.
- No!

210
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,501
Give me the tape recorder.

211
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,183
Tell us, Rose.

212
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,828
It's been 84 years.

213
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,740
It's okay. Just try to remember 
anything, anything at all.

214
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,388
Do you want to hear this 
or not, Mr. Lovett?

215
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:42,068
It's been 84 years ...

216
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:46,337
and I can still smell the fresh paint.

217
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:50,625
The china had never been used.

218
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:54,138
The sheets had never been slept in.

219
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:59,665
Titanic was called "The Ship of Dreams".

220
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:02,423
And it was.

221
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:04,902
It really was.

222
00:20:33,628 --> 00:20:37,780
All third-class passengers
with a forward berth ...

223
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:40,666
this way, please! 
This queue! Right here ...

224
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:43,740
- It's a big boat, huh?
- Daddy, it's a ship.

225
00:20:43,828 --> 00:20:45,226
You're right.

226
00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:16,101
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

227
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:18,702
It doesn't look any bigger
than the Mauretania.

228
00:21:18,786 --> 00:21:22,017
You can be blasé about some things, 
Rose, but not about Titanic.

229
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:26,065
It's over 100 feet longer than 
Mauretania, and far more luxurious.

230
00:21:26,186 --> 00:21:29,337
Your daughter is far too difficult
to impress, Ruth.

231
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:31,701
So this is the ship 
they say is unsinkable.

232
00:21:31,786 --> 00:21:34,300
It is unsinkable.
God himself could not sink this ship.

233
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:37,105
Sir, you have to check your baggage
through the main terminal.

234
00:21:37,186 --> 00:21:38,221
It's round that way, sir.

235
00:21:38,306 --> 00:21:40,661
I put my faith in you, good sir.
Now, kindly see my man.

236
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:43,419
Yes, sir. It's my pleasure, sir.
If I can do anything at all ...

237
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:44,780
Yes, right.

238
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:48,619
All the trunks from that car there.
12 from here.

239
00:21:49,386 --> 00:21:53,901
And the safe, to the parlor suite,
rooms B-52, 54, 56.

240
00:21:55,865 --> 00:21:59,221
Ladies, we better hurry. Come along.

241
00:22:03,785 --> 00:22:05,696
- My coat?
- I have it, miss.

242
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:08,174
Queue here for health inspection.

243
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:11,894
All third-class passengers
queue here for health inspection.

244
00:22:12,545 --> 00:22:13,739
Chin up.

245
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,217
- Welcome aboard, ma'am.
- Welcome to Titanic.

246
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:25,613
It was the ship of dreams
to everyone else.

247
00:22:26,264 --> 00:22:28,380
To me, it was a slave ship ...

248
00:22:28,944 --> 00:22:31,663
taking me back to America in chains.

249
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:36,743
Outwardly, I was everything
a well brought up girl should be.

250
00:22:37,104 --> 00:22:39,174
Inside, I was screaming.

251
00:22:55,344 --> 00:22:58,301
Jack, you are pazzo.
You bet everything we have.

252
00:22:59,303 --> 00:23:02,181
When you got nothing,
you got nothing to lose.

253
00:23:08,903 --> 00:23:10,018
Sven?

254
00:23:10,903 --> 00:23:11,892
Bet.

255
00:23:30,462 --> 00:23:31,451
All right.

256
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:34,739
Moment of truth.
Somebody's life is about to change.

257
00:23:35,862 --> 00:23:36,977
Brizio?

258
00:23:39,062 --> 00:23:40,461
- Niente.
- Niente.

259
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:42,891
Olaf?

260
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:44,971
Nothing.

261
00:23:45,222 --> 00:23:46,257
Sven?

262
00:23:50,582 --> 00:23:51,810
2 pair.

263
00:23:52,382 --> 00:23:53,940
I'm sorry, Fabrizio.

264
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:55,932
Che sorry, ma vaffanculo!
Did you bet all our money?

265
00:23:56,021 --> 00:23:59,900
I'm sorry, you're not going to
see your mom again for a long time.

266
00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:03,219
'Cause we're going to America.
Full house, boys.

267
00:24:16,661 --> 00:24:17,776
Come on.

268
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:20,340
I'm going home!

269
00:24:22,981 --> 00:24:25,541
- I'm going home.
- I go to America!

270
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:27,374
No, mate.

271
00:24:27,621 --> 00:24:31,056
Titanic go to America, in 5 minutes.

272
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:34,328
Shit, Fabri. Come on. Come on, here.

273
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,978
We're riding in high style now.
We're a couple of regular swells.

274
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,052
We're practically goddamn royalty,
ragazzo mio.

275
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,176
You see? Is my destino.

276
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,491
Like I told you,
I go to America to be millionaire.

277
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,417
- You are pazzo.
- Maybe, but I've got the tickets.

278
00:24:56,179 --> 00:24:58,488
- I thought you were fast.
- Aspetta!

279
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:01,293
Wait! Hey, wait!

280
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,371
We're passengers! Passengers!

281
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:07,211
Have you been through
the inspection queue?

282
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:08,334
Of course.

283
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:11,570
Anyway, we don't have any lice.
We're Americans, both of us.

284
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:13,457
Right. Come aboard.

285
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:20,289
We're the luckiest sons of bitches
in the world. You know that?

286
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:30,293
Goodbye!

287
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:36,536
- You know somebody?
- Of course not. That's not the point.

288
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,973
- Goodbye. I'll miss you.
- Goodbye!

289
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:41,618
- Goodbye.
- I will never forget you!

290
00:26:27,537 --> 00:26:29,255
Come with me, darling. Let's go.

291
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,570
G-60.

292
00:26:36,056 --> 00:26:37,614
Excuse me, ma'am.

293
00:26:40,936 --> 00:26:42,255
Right here.

294
00:26:42,456 --> 00:26:45,607
How you doing? Jack. 
Nice to meet you.

295
00:26:46,096 --> 00:26:48,769
Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.
How you doing?

296
00:26:49,616 --> 00:26:51,766
Who says you get top bunk?

297
00:26:57,136 --> 00:26:59,525
This is your private 
promenade deck, sir.

298
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:02,335
Would you be requiring anything?
Excuse me.

299
00:27:03,256 --> 00:27:04,689
- This one?
- No.

300
00:27:04,976 --> 00:27:06,967
It had a lot of faces on it.

301
00:27:07,975 --> 00:27:09,488
This is the one.

302
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:12,851
Would you like all of them out, miss?

303
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:15,608
Yes, we need a little color in this room.

304
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,127
Put it in there. In the wardrobe.

305
00:27:21,775 --> 00:27:24,005
God, not those finger-paintings again.

306
00:27:24,095 --> 00:27:25,892
They certainly were a waste of money.

307
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:29,251
The difference between Cal's taste
in art and mine is that I have some.

308
00:27:29,335 --> 00:27:31,007
They're fascinating ...

309
00:27:31,135 --> 00:27:33,444
like being inside a dream or something.

310
00:27:33,655 --> 00:27:35,134
There's truth, but no logic.

311
00:27:35,215 --> 00:27:38,206
- What's the artist's name?
- Something Picasso.

312
00:27:38,294 --> 00:27:42,287
Something Picasso. He won't amount
to a thing. He won't, trust me.

313
00:27:42,374 --> 00:27:45,127
- Put the Degas in the bedroom.
- At least they were cheap.

314
00:27:45,774 --> 00:27:47,685
Put it in the wardrobe.

315
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:56,486
At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard
named Margaret Brown.

316
00:27:56,814 --> 00:27:58,691
We all called her Molly.

317
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:01,931
History would call her
the "Unsinkable Molly Brown".

318
00:28:02,054 --> 00:28:04,614
I wasn't about to wait 
all day for you, sonny.

319
00:28:04,694 --> 00:28:06,889
Here, if you think you can manage.

320
00:28:06,974 --> 00:28:09,965
Her husband had struck gold,
someplace out west.

321
00:28:10,053 --> 00:28:13,012
And she was what mother called
"New Money. "

322
00:28:14,253 --> 00:28:17,051
By the next afternoon,
we were steaming west ...

323
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:19,124
from the coast of Ireland ...

324
00:28:19,213 --> 00:28:21,966
with nothing out ahead of us but ocean.

325
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:32,291
Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.
Let's stretch her legs.

326
00:28:32,653 --> 00:28:33,881
Yes, sir.

327
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:38,732
- All ahead full, Mr. Moody.
- Very good, sir.

328
00:28:43,612 --> 00:28:45,092
All ahead full.

329
00:28:45,492 --> 00:28:47,244
All ahead full!

330
00:28:47,652 --> 00:28:49,449
Come on, lads, step lively.

331
00:28:55,852 --> 00:28:57,524
What's the reading?

332
00:29:06,732 --> 00:29:10,202
All right! Let's stoke her right up!
We go full ahead!

333
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:12,168
Come on, right back to work.

334
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,568
21 knots, sir.

335
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:16,727
Hey, look!

336
00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:20,483
See it?

337
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:26,039
There's another one. See him?

338
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:38,038
Look at that one! Look at him jump!

339
00:31:02,288 --> 00:31:04,927
I can see the Statue of Liberty already.

340
00:31:05,288 --> 00:31:07,006
Very small, of course.

341
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:12,808
I'm the king of the world!

342
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:01,318
She's the largest moving object ever made
by the hand of man in all history.

343
00:32:02,526 --> 00:32:06,758
And our master shipbuilder, Mr. Andrews,
here, designed her from the keel plates up.

344
00:32:06,846 --> 00:32:10,555
I may have knocked her together,
but the idea was Mr. Ismay's.

345
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,804
He envisioned a steamer
so grand in scale ...

346
00:32:13,926 --> 00:32:17,839
and so luxurious in its appointments that
its supremacy would never be challenged.

347
00:32:17,926 --> 00:32:21,521
And here she is, 
willed into solid reality.

348
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,924
Hear, hear.

349
00:32:23,806 --> 00:32:25,478
The salmon.

350
00:32:28,325 --> 00:32:30,555
You know I don't like that, Rose.

351
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:35,279
She knows.

352
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:41,474
We'll both have the lamb.
Rare, with very little mint sauce.

353
00:32:42,685 --> 00:32:44,437
You like lamb, right, sweet pea?

354
00:32:44,525 --> 00:32:45,514
Sausage.

355
00:32:46,845 --> 00:32:49,279
You gonna cut her meat for her,
too, there, Cal?

356
00:32:51,245 --> 00:32:53,884
Hey, who thought of the name Titanic?

357
00:32:54,725 --> 00:32:57,034
- Was it you, Bruce?
- Yes, actually.

358
00:32:57,805 --> 00:33:00,159
I wanted to convey sheer size.

359
00:33:00,364 --> 00:33:02,958
And size means stability, luxury ...

360
00:33:03,404 --> 00:33:05,235
and above all, strength.

361
00:33:06,244 --> 00:33:08,553
Do you know of Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?

362
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:10,999
His ideas about
the male preoccupation with size ...

363
00:33:11,084 --> 00:33:13,439
might be of particular interest to you.

364
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:15,881
What's gotten into you?

365
00:33:15,964 --> 00:33:17,158
Excuse me.

366
00:33:21,484 --> 00:33:22,917
I do apologize.

367
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:25,837
She's a pistol, Cal.
Hope you can handle her.

368
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:28,353
I may have to start minding
what she reads from now on ...

369
00:33:28,444 --> 00:33:29,797
won't I, Mrs. Brown?

370
00:33:29,964 --> 00:33:32,352
Freud, who is he? Is he a passenger?

371
00:33:44,203 --> 00:33:46,239
The ship is nice?

372
00:33:46,323 --> 00:33:47,881
Yeah, it's an Irish ship.

373
00:33:47,963 --> 00:33:49,282
Is English, no?

374
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:52,002
No, it was built in Ireland.
15,000 Irishmen built this ship.

375
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:54,472
Solid as a rock. Big Irish hands.

376
00:33:55,123 --> 00:33:56,602
Well, that's typical.

377
00:33:56,683 --> 00:33:59,436
First-class dogs come down here
to take a shit.

378
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:02,196
Lets us know where we rank
in the scheme of things.

379
00:34:02,283 --> 00:34:04,000
Like we could forget.

380
00:34:05,282 --> 00:34:06,601
I'm Tommy Ryan.

381
00:34:06,682 --> 00:34:08,081
- Jack Dawson.
- Hello.

382
00:34:08,162 --> 00:34:09,641
- Fabrizio.
- Hi.

383
00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:13,076
Do you make any money
with your drawings?

384
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:23,555
Forget it, boyo.

385
00:34:24,322 --> 00:34:26,313
You'd as like have angels
fly out of your arse ...

386
00:34:26,402 --> 00:34:28,631
as get next to the likes of her.

387
00:34:50,761 --> 00:34:54,151
I saw my whole life
as if I'd already lived it.

388
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,952
An endless parade of parties
and cotillions ...

389
00:34:58,441 --> 00:35:00,352
yachts and polo matches.

390
00:35:00,961 --> 00:35:05,000
Always the same narrow people,
the same mindless chatter.

391
00:35:06,161 --> 00:35:09,152
I felt like I was standing at
a great precipice ...

392
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,230
with no one to pull me back.

393
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,198
No one who cared ...

394
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,153
or even noticed.

395
00:37:02,877 --> 00:37:04,196
Don't do it.

396
00:37:04,677 --> 00:37:05,951
Stay back.

397
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:08,669
Don't come any closer.

398
00:37:09,517 --> 00:37:12,030
Come on. Just give me your hand,
I'll pull you back over.

399
00:37:12,117 --> 00:37:13,947
No! Stay where you are.

400
00:37:14,476 --> 00:37:15,796
I mean it.

401
00:37:16,356 --> 00:37:17,675
I'll let go.

402
00:37:28,476 --> 00:37:29,909
No, you won't.

403
00:37:31,196 --> 00:37:33,152
What do you mean, no I won't?

404
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:37,150
Don't presume to tell me what I will
and will not do. You don't know me.

405
00:37:37,236 --> 00:37:39,704
Well, you would have done it already.

406
00:37:39,956 --> 00:37:42,150
You're distracting me. Go away.

407
00:37:42,316 --> 00:37:44,307
I can't. I'm involved now.

408
00:37:45,756 --> 00:37:48,508
You let go, and I'm gonna have 
to jump in there after you.

409
00:37:50,555 --> 00:37:52,034
Don't be absurd.

410
00:37:52,475 --> 00:37:54,943
- You'll be killed.
- I'm a good swimmer.

411
00:37:55,035 --> 00:37:56,866
The fall alone will kill you.

412
00:37:56,955 --> 00:37:59,594
It would hurt. 
I'm not saying it wouldn't.

413
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,186
To tell you the truth,
I'm a lot more concerned ...

414
00:38:02,275 --> 00:38:04,345
about that water being so cold.

415
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:12,749
How cold?

416
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:15,713
Freezing. 
Maybe a couple of degrees over.

417
00:38:20,594 --> 00:38:23,062
You ever ... 
You ever been to Wisconsin?

418
00:38:26,674 --> 00:38:27,709
What?

419
00:38:27,874 --> 00:38:30,547
They have some of the coldest
winters around.

420
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:32,989
I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls.

421
00:38:33,154 --> 00:38:36,191
I remember, when I was a kid,
me and my father ...

422
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,782
we went ice fishing 
out on Lake Wissota.

423
00:38:39,314 --> 00:38:42,989
- Ice fishing is, you know, where you —
- I know what ice fishing is.

424
00:38:43,714 --> 00:38:44,863
Sorry.

425
00:38:46,274 --> 00:38:49,471
You just seem like,
you know, kind of an indoor girl.

426
00:38:51,394 --> 00:38:52,621
Anyway, I ...

427
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:55,703
I fell through some thin ice.

428
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,385
And I'm telling you ...

429
00:38:58,593 --> 00:39:00,185
water that cold ...

430
00:39:00,513 --> 00:39:02,344
like right down there ...

431
00:39:02,913 --> 00:39:06,792
it hits you like a 1,000 knives
stabbing you all over your body.

432
00:39:07,393 --> 00:39:10,191
You can't breathe. You can't think.

433
00:39:11,633 --> 00:39:14,227
Least, not about anything but the pain.

434
00:39:16,913 --> 00:39:20,542
Which is why I'm not looking forward
to jumping in there after you.

435
00:39:21,273 --> 00:39:22,706
Like I said ...

436
00:39:23,592 --> 00:39:25,389
I don't have a choice.

437
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:32,024
I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll 
come back over the rail an ...

438
00:39:32,112 --> 00:39:33,909
and get me off the hook here.

439
00:39:34,232 --> 00:39:35,665
You're crazy.

440
00:39:36,912 --> 00:39:38,903
That's what everybody says bu ...

441
00:39:40,352 --> 00:39:42,183
but with all due respect, miss ...

442
00:39:42,272 --> 00:39:45,150
I'm not the one hanging off
the back of a ship here.

443
00:39:45,672 --> 00:39:46,866
Come on.

444
00:39:47,592 --> 00:39:49,184
Give me your hand.

445
00:39:49,632 --> 00:39:51,623
You don't want to do this.

446
00:40:06,631 --> 00:40:08,189
I'm Jack Dawson.

447
00:40:09,631 --> 00:40:11,508
Rose Dewitt Bukater.

448
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:14,424
I'll have to get you 
to write that one down.

449
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:16,745
Come on.

450
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,623
I got you. Come on.

451
00:40:24,431 --> 00:40:25,624
Come on!

452
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,429
Help, please!

453
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:37,307
- Please, help me!
- Listen to me. I've got you.

454
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,069
I won't let go.

455
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,266
Now pull yourself up. Come on!

456
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,787
Come on. That's right.

457
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,863
You can do it.

458
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,509
I got you.

459
00:40:58,909 --> 00:41:00,467
What's all this?

460
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:08,463
You stand back! 
And don't move an inch!

461
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:12,268
Fetch the master-at-arms.

462
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:16,499
This is completely unacceptable.

463
00:41:16,789 --> 00:41:20,304
What made you think you could
put your hands on my fiancée?

464
00:41:20,669 --> 00:41:22,261
Look at me, you filth!

465
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:24,385
- Cal.
- What do you think you were doing?

466
00:41:24,469 --> 00:41:26,584
Cal, stop. It was an accident.

467
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:29,061
An accident?

468
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:30,858
It was.

469
00:41:32,028 --> 00:41:33,427
Stupid, really.

470
00:41:33,508 --> 00:41:35,783
I was leaning over and I slipped.

471
00:41:38,308 --> 00:41:40,822
I was leaning far over to see the ...

472
00:41:45,468 --> 00:41:47,584
- Propellers?
- Propellers, and I slipped.

473
00:41:47,668 --> 00:41:51,343
And I would have gone overboard,
but Mr. Dawson here saved me.

474
00:41:51,588 --> 00:41:53,738
And almost went over himself.

475
00:41:54,228 --> 00:41:56,025
She wanted to see the propellers.

476
00:41:56,108 --> 00:41:58,906
Like I said,
women and machinery do not mix.

477
00:41:59,788 --> 00:42:01,619
Was that the way of it?

478
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,303
Yeah, that was pretty much it.

479
00:42:06,387 --> 00:42:09,299
Well, the boy's a hero, then.
Good for you, son. Well done.

480
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:12,425
So, it's all's well and 
back to our brandy, eh?
- Aha.

481
00:42:13,707 --> 00:42:17,097
Look at you. You must be freezing.
Let's get you inside.

482
00:42:18,147 --> 00:42:20,741
Err ... perhaps a little 
something for the boy?

483
00:42:22,547 --> 00:42:23,821
Of course.

484
00:42:24,267 --> 00:42:25,620
Mr. Lovejoy ...

485
00:42:25,707 --> 00:42:27,857
I think a 20 should do it.

486
00:42:28,187 --> 00:42:31,384
Is that the going rate
for saving the woman you love?

487
00:42:32,147 --> 00:42:33,819
Rose is displeased.

488
00:42:34,507 --> 00:42:35,825
What to do?

489
00:42:36,506 --> 00:42:37,621
I know.

490
00:42:39,706 --> 00:42:42,982
Perhaps you could join us
for dinner tomorrow evening.

491
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:46,897
To regale our group 
with your heroic tale.

492
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:51,298
Sure. Count me in.

493
00:42:51,866 --> 00:42:53,697
Good. It's settled then.

494
00:42:55,066 --> 00:42:57,102
This should be interesting.

495
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:07,335
Can I bum a smoke?

496
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,341
You'll want to tie those.

497
00:43:20,105 --> 00:43:23,142
It's interesting.
The young lady slipped so suddenly ...

498
00:43:23,265 --> 00:43:26,735
and you still had time to remove
your jacket and your shoes.

499
00:43:41,984 --> 00:43:44,134
I know you've been melancholy.

500
00:43:45,224 --> 00:43:47,215
I don't pretend to know why.

501
00:43:49,624 --> 00:43:51,535
I intended to save this ...

502
00:43:51,704 --> 00:43:56,300
until the engagement gala next week.

503
00:43:57,784 --> 00:44:01,936
But I thought, tonight.

504
00:44:02,784 --> 00:44:04,183
Good gracious!

505
00:44:04,664 --> 00:44:07,736
Perhaps as a reminder
of my feelings for you.

506
00:44:08,144 --> 00:44:10,020
- Is it a —
- Diamond? Yes.

507
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,972
56 carats to be exact.

508
00:44:17,463 --> 00:44:19,374
It was worn by Louis XVI.

509
00:44:20,303 --> 00:44:22,692
And they called it "Le Coeur de la Mer".

510
00:44:22,783 --> 00:44:26,093
- The "Heart of the Ocean".
- The "Heart of the Ocean". Yes.

511
00:44:31,063 --> 00:44:32,701
It's overwhelming.

512
00:44:32,983 --> 00:44:34,780
It's for royalty.

513
00:44:35,863 --> 00:44:37,614
We are royalty, Rose.

514
00:44:41,783 --> 00:44:44,660
You know, there is nothing
I couldn't give you.

515
00:44:44,822 --> 00:44:46,858
There is nothing I'd deny you ...

516
00:44:47,302 --> 00:44:49,133
if you would not deny me.

517
00:44:53,462 --> 00:44:55,532
Open your heart to me, Rose.

518
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:12,972
I've been on my own since I was 15.

519
00:45:13,061 --> 00:45:14,734
Since my folks died.

520
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:19,210
And I had no brothers or sisters
or close kin in that part of the country.

521
00:45:19,581 --> 00:45:22,414
So I lit on out of there
and I haven't been back since.

522
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:25,732
You can just call me
a tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

523
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:31,495
Well, Rose, we've walked
about a mile around this boat deck ...

524
00:45:32,221 --> 00:45:35,418
chewed over how great
the weather's been and how I grew up ...

525
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:39,216
but I reckon that's not
why you came to talk to me, is it?

526
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:42,013
- Mr. Dawson, I —
- Jack.

527
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,329
Jack ...

528
00:45:44,781 --> 00:45:47,248
I want to thank you for what you did.

529
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:51,059
Not just for pulling me back ...

530
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,333
- but for your discretion.
- You're welcome.

531
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,089
Look ...

532
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,009
I know what you must be thinking:

533
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,810
"Poor little rich girl.
What does she know about misery?"

534
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,489
No.

535
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,458
That's not what I was thinking.

536
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,293
What I was thinking was ...

537
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:13,055
what could have happened to this girl
to make her think she had no way out?

538
00:46:14,659 --> 00:46:15,979
Well, I ...

539
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,253
It was everything.

540
00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:21,490
It was my whole world
and all the people in it.

541
00:46:21,899 --> 00:46:23,810
And the inertia of my life ...

542
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:26,977
plunging ahead,
and me, powerless to stop it.

543
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,536
God, look at that thing.

544
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:32,253
You'd have gone straight 
to the bottom.

545
00:46:33,619 --> 00:46:36,213
500 invitations have gone out.

546
00:46:36,299 --> 00:46:38,972
All of Philadelphia society 
will be there.

547
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:41,368
And all the while, I feel I'm  ...

548
00:46:41,459 --> 00:46:43,654
standing in the middle of
a crowded room ...

549
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:46,697
screaming at the top of my lungs,
and no one even looks up.

550
00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:49,612
Do you love him?

551
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:51,652
Pardon me?

552
00:46:51,738 --> 00:46:53,251
Do you love him?

553
00:46:53,698 --> 00:46:56,849
You're being very rude.
You shouldn't be asking me this.

554
00:46:56,938 --> 00:47:00,055
It's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?

555
00:47:01,658 --> 00:47:03,614
This is not a suitable conversation.

556
00:47:03,698 --> 00:47:06,258
Why can't you 
just answer the question?

557
00:47:07,498 --> 00:47:08,977
This is absurd.

558
00:47:09,138 --> 00:47:10,935
You don't know me 
and I don't know you ...

559
00:47:11,018 --> 00:47:13,452
and we are not having
this conversation at all.

560
00:47:13,538 --> 00:47:16,336
You are rude and uncouth
and presumptuous and ...

561
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:17,771
I am leaving now.

562
00:47:17,858 --> 00:47:20,417
Jack, Mr. Dawson, 
it's been a pleasure.

563
00:47:20,498 --> 00:47:22,887
I sought you out to thank you
and now I have thanked you —

564
00:47:22,977 --> 00:47:24,774
And you've insulted me.

565
00:47:24,897 --> 00:47:26,455
Well, you deserved it.

566
00:47:26,537 --> 00:47:27,970
- Right.
- Right.

567
00:47:30,737 --> 00:47:33,092
- I thought you were leaving.
- I am.

568
00:47:35,737 --> 00:47:37,455
You are so annoying.

569
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:40,567
Wait, I don't have to leave.

570
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:43,251
This is my part of the ship. 
You leave.

571
00:47:44,017 --> 00:47:46,611
Well, well, well! 
Now who's being rude?

572
00:47:50,697 --> 00:47:53,733
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?

573
00:47:54,616 --> 00:47:57,255
So, what are you, 
an artist or something?

574
00:48:00,936 --> 00:48:02,733
These are rather good.

575
00:48:05,656 --> 00:48:08,454
They're — they're very good, actually.

576
00:48:15,616 --> 00:48:17,527
Jack, this is exquisite work.

577
00:48:17,616 --> 00:48:20,335
They didn't think too much
of them in old Paree.

578
00:48:20,416 --> 00:48:21,484
Paris?

579
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,926
You do get around for a ...

580
00:48:28,055 --> 00:48:30,091
Well, a person of limited means.

581
00:48:30,175 --> 00:48:32,450
Go on, a poor guy. You can say it.

582
00:48:35,815 --> 00:48:37,373
Well, well, well.

583
00:48:41,855 --> 00:48:44,050
And these were drawn from life?

584
00:48:46,735 --> 00:48:48,805
That's one of the good things 
about Paris.

585
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:51,852
Lots of girls willing to take
their clothes off.

586
00:48:56,815 --> 00:48:58,567
You liked this woman.

587
00:48:58,815 --> 00:49:00,805
You used her several times.

588
00:49:03,694 --> 00:49:06,003
Well, she had beautiful hands, 
you see?

589
00:49:08,174 --> 00:49:10,244
I think you must have had
a love affair with her.

590
00:49:10,334 --> 00:49:12,564
No, no, no, no — just with her hands.

591
00:49:13,094 --> 00:49:15,369
She was a one-legged prostitute.

592
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:17,643
See?

593
00:49:23,734 --> 00:49:26,293
She had a good sense of humor, though.

594
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,846
And this lady ...

595
00:49:30,813 --> 00:49:33,247
she used to sit 
at this bar every night ...

596
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:35,847
wearing every piece of jewelry
she owned just ...

597
00:49:35,933 --> 00:49:38,367
waiting for her long lost love.

598
00:49:38,853 --> 00:49:40,889
We called her Madame Bijoux.

599
00:49:41,293 --> 00:49:43,727
See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.

600
00:49:44,893 --> 00:49:47,043
Well, you have a gift, Jack.

601
00:49:47,853 --> 00:49:48,968
You do.

602
00:49:49,613 --> 00:49:52,332
- You see people.
- I see you.

603
00:49:54,733 --> 00:49:55,767
And?

604
00:49:57,533 --> 00:49:59,489
You wouldn't have jumped.

605
00:50:03,213 --> 00:50:06,761
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

606
00:50:07,012 --> 00:50:08,968
Rose has already done that.

607
00:50:09,052 --> 00:50:11,725
Look, here comes that vulgar
"Brown" woman.

608
00:50:11,932 --> 00:50:14,571
Quickly, get up 
before she sits with us.

609
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:18,126
Hello, girls.
I was hoping I'd catch you at tea.

610
00:50:18,212 --> 00:50:20,282
We're awfully sorry. You missed it.

611
00:50:20,372 --> 00:50:23,330
The Countess and I were just off
to take the air on the boat deck.

612
00:50:23,412 --> 00:50:26,563
What a lovely idea.
I need to catch up on my gossip.

613
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:30,880
Countess.

614
00:50:32,331 --> 00:50:35,004
You've not yet lit 
the last 4 boilers?

615
00:50:35,371 --> 00:50:37,248
No, I don't see the need.

616
00:50:37,331 --> 00:50:39,367
We are making excellent time.

617
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:41,922
The press knows the size of Titanic.

618
00:50:42,011 --> 00:50:44,320
Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.

619
00:50:44,411 --> 00:50:47,050
We must give them
something new to print.

620
00:50:48,571 --> 00:50:51,688
This maiden voyage of Titanic
must make headlines.

621
00:50:52,811 --> 00:50:54,210
Mr. Ismay ...

622
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:59,323
I would prefer not to push the engines
until they've been properly run in.

623
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:01,604
Of course, I'm just a passenger.

624
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:04,329
I leave it to your good offices
to decide what's best.

625
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:07,004
But what a glorious end
to your final crossing ...

626
00:51:07,091 --> 00:51:10,366
if we were to get into New York
on Tuesday night and surprise them all.

627
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:12,327
Make the morning papers.

628
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:14,560
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?

629
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:19,358
Good man.

630
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:22,890
Well, after that, I worked 
on a squid boat in Monterey,

631
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:26,243
then I went down to Los Angeles
to the pier in Santa Monica ...

632
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:29,606
and started doing portraits there
for 10 cents a piece.

633
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,886
Why can't I be like you, Jack?

634
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:35,245
Just head out for the horizon
whenever I feel like it.

635
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,927
Say we'll go there sometime, 
to that pier ...

636
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:42,523
even if we only ever 
just talk about it.

637
00:51:42,609 --> 00:51:45,282
No, we'll do it. 
We'll drink cheap beer,

638
00:51:45,529 --> 00:51:48,407
we'll ride on the roller coaster
till we throw up.

639
00:51:48,489 --> 00:51:51,561
Then we'll ride horses on the beach,
right in the surf.

640
00:51:51,649 --> 00:51:55,642
But you'll have to do it like a real 
cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.

641
00:51:55,969 --> 00:51:58,483
- You mean, one leg on each side?
- Yeah.

642
00:52:00,009 --> 00:52:02,443
- Can you show me?
- Sure, if you like.

643
00:52:04,369 --> 00:52:06,200
Teach me to ride like a man.

644
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,165
And chew tobacco like a man.

645
00:52:08,848 --> 00:52:10,726
And spit like a man.

646
00:52:10,808 --> 00:52:13,197
What, they didn't teach you that
in finishing school?

647
00:52:13,288 --> 00:52:14,277
No.

648
00:52:15,008 --> 00:52:17,124
Come on, I'll show you. Let's do it.

649
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:18,561
I'll show you how, come on.

650
00:52:18,648 --> 00:52:20,445
- Jack, no.
- Come on.

651
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:22,405
- No. Wait, Jack.
- Come on.

652
00:52:22,728 --> 00:52:24,958
No, Jack. I couldn't possibly, Jack.

653
00:52:25,048 --> 00:52:26,481
Watch closely.

654
00:52:28,448 --> 00:52:30,040
That's disgusting.

655
00:52:30,288 --> 00:52:32,006
All right, your turn.

656
00:52:33,248 --> 00:52:35,682
That was pitiful.
Come on, you really gotta hawk it back.

657
00:52:35,768 --> 00:52:38,327
Get some leverage to it, 
use your arms ...

658
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:39,841
arc your neck.

659
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:42,837
You see the range on that thing?

660
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:44,760
Okay, go.

661
00:52:47,807 --> 00:52:50,002
- That was better. You got to work on it.
- Really?

662
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:53,796
Really try to hawk it up
and get some body to it. You gotta ...

663
00:53:00,407 --> 00:53:01,556
Mother.

664
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,757
May I introduce Jack Dawson?

665
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:11,805
Charmed, I'm sure.

666
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,681
The others were gracious 
and curious ...

667
00:53:18,766 --> 00:53:21,075
about the man who'd saved my life.

668
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:24,885
But my mother looked at him
like an insect.

669
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:28,995
A dangerous insect
which must be squashed quickly.

670
00:53:29,646 --> 00:53:33,639
Jack, sounds like you're a good man
to have around in a sticky spot.

671
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,355
Why do they always insist on
announcing dinner ...

672
00:53:38,446 --> 00:53:40,436
like a damn cavalry charge?

673
00:53:40,806 --> 00:53:42,796
Shall we go dress, Mother?

674
00:53:43,446 --> 00:53:45,322
See you at dinner, Jack.

675
00:53:47,245 --> 00:53:48,280
Son?

676
00:53:48,566 --> 00:53:49,600
Son!

677
00:53:50,325 --> 00:53:53,522
Do you have the slightest comprehension
of what you're doing?

678
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:54,640
Not really.

679
00:53:54,725 --> 00:53:57,193
You're about to go into the snake pit.

680
00:53:59,285 --> 00:54:01,435
What are you planning to wear?

681
00:54:04,005 --> 00:54:05,677
I figured. Come on.

682
00:54:08,325 --> 00:54:09,804
I was right.

683
00:54:10,285 --> 00:54:12,673
You and my son
are just about the same size.

684
00:54:12,765 --> 00:54:14,163
Pretty close.

685
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,120
You shine up like a new penny.

686
00:54:31,604 --> 00:54:33,196
Good evening, sir.

687
00:55:34,562 --> 00:55:37,679
There are several thousand tons
of Hockley steel in this very ship.

688
00:55:37,762 --> 00:55:39,957
- Which part?
- All the right ones, of course.

689
00:55:40,042 --> 00:55:42,431
Then we'll know who to hold accountable
if there's a problem.

690
00:55:42,522 --> 00:55:44,672
- Where's my daughter?
- She'll be along.

691
00:55:44,762 --> 00:55:46,514
There is the Countess.

692
00:55:46,642 --> 00:55:48,394
- Hello, my dear.
- Good evening, Cal.

693
00:55:48,482 --> 00:55:50,278
So good to see you.

694
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:18,270
I saw that in a nickelodeon once
and I always wanted to do it.

695
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,392
I'll see you at dinner.

696
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,994
Darling ...

697
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,555
surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

698
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,114
Dawson.

699
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,599
That's amazing.

700
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,474
You could almost pass 
for a gentleman.

701
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,994
Almost.

702
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,798
Extraordinary.

703
00:56:56,999 --> 00:56:59,593
My dear, it's delightful to see you.

704
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:00,993
What a remarkable voyage this is.

705
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:03,547
- It's mad, isn't it?
- Completely lunatic.

706
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:06,749
There's the Countess of Rothes.

707
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:11,669
And that's John Jacob Astor ...

708
00:57:11,959 --> 00:57:13,677
the richest man on the ship.

709
00:57:13,759 --> 00:57:17,593
His little wifey there, Madeleine,
is my age, and in a delicate condition.

710
00:57:18,399 --> 00:57:20,151
See how she's trying to hide it?

711
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:21,797
Quite the scandal.

712
00:57:22,279 --> 00:57:25,669
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim
and his mistress, Madame Aubert.

713
00:57:25,758 --> 00:57:28,875
Mrs. Guggenheim is at home
with the children, of course.

714
00:57:28,959 --> 00:57:32,348
And over here, we have Sir Cosmo
and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.

715
00:57:32,438 --> 00:57:35,669
She designs naughty lingerie,
among her many talents.

716
00:57:35,998 --> 00:57:38,114
Very popular with the royals.

717
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:41,392
Congratulations, Hockley. 
She's splendid.

718
00:57:41,478 --> 00:57:42,911
Why, thank you.

719
00:57:43,398 --> 00:57:46,276
- Care to escort a lady to dinner?
- Certainly.

720
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,277
Sweet pea?

721
00:57:50,438 --> 00:57:53,475
Ain't nothing to it, is there, Jack?
Remember, they love money.

722
00:57:53,558 --> 00:57:56,675
So just pretend like you own a 
gold mine and you're in the club.

723
00:57:59,078 --> 00:58:00,305
Hey, Astor.

724
00:58:01,397 --> 00:58:03,627
Hello, Molly, nice to see you.

725
00:58:04,157 --> 00:58:06,671
J.J., Madeleine,
I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

726
00:58:06,757 --> 00:58:08,190
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.

727
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:09,710
Well, Jack ...

728
00:58:10,117 --> 00:58:12,233
are you of the Boston Dawsons?

729
00:58:12,677 --> 00:58:15,271
No, the Chippewa Falls 
Dawsons, actually.

730
00:58:15,357 --> 00:58:16,506
Oh, yes.

731
00:58:18,517 --> 00:58:21,634
He must have been nervous,
but he never faltered.

732
00:58:23,117 --> 00:58:25,267
They assumed he was one of them.

733
00:58:25,357 --> 00:58:27,951
Heir to a railroad fortune, perhaps.

734
00:58:28,957 --> 00:58:32,187
New money, obviously,
but still a member of the club.

735
00:58:33,596 --> 00:58:36,633
Mother, of course,
could always be counted upon.

736
00:58:37,476 --> 00:58:40,434
Tell us of the accommodations
in steerage, Mr. Dawson.

737
00:58:40,516 --> 00:58:42,234
I hear they're quite good 
on this ship.

738
00:58:43,636 --> 00:58:46,389
The best I've seen, ma'am. 
Hardly any rats.

739
00:58:49,596 --> 00:58:52,315
Mr. Dawson is joining us
from the third class.

740
00:58:52,396 --> 00:58:54,785
He was of some assistance
to my fiancée last night.

741
00:58:54,876 --> 00:58:57,629
It turns out that Mr. Dawson
is quite a fine artist.

742
00:58:57,716 --> 00:59:00,708
He was kind enough to show me
some of his work today.

743
00:59:00,796 --> 00:59:03,788
Rose and I differ somewhat
in our definition of fine art.

744
00:59:03,876 --> 00:59:05,945
Not to impugn your work, sir.

745
00:59:15,835 --> 00:59:17,029
Are these all for me?

746
00:59:17,115 --> 00:59:19,106
Just start from the outside
and work your way in.

747
00:59:19,195 --> 00:59:21,470
He knows every rivet in her,
don't you, Thomas?

748
00:59:21,555 --> 00:59:24,023
Your ship is a wonder, 
Mr. Andrews. Truly.

749
00:59:24,115 --> 00:59:25,628
Thank you, Rose.

750
00:59:28,475 --> 00:59:29,954
How do you take your caviar, sir?

751
00:59:30,035 --> 00:59:31,831
No caviar for me, thanks.

752
00:59:31,915 --> 00:59:33,746
Never did like it much.

753
00:59:34,995 --> 00:59:37,667
And where exactly do you live,
Mr. Dawson?

754
00:59:37,834 --> 00:59:40,632
Right now, my address 
is the RMS Titanic.

755
00:59:41,274 --> 00:59:43,424
After that, I'm on God's good humor.

756
00:59:43,514 --> 00:59:46,074
And how is it you have means to travel?

757
00:59:46,154 --> 00:59:48,270
I work my way from place to place.

758
00:59:48,354 --> 00:59:50,549
You know, tramp steamers and such.

759
00:59:50,634 --> 00:59:54,024
But I won my ticket on Titanic here
at a lucky hand at poker.

760
00:59:54,154 --> 00:59:55,746
A very lucky hand.

761
00:59:56,474 --> 00:59:58,510
All life is a game of luck.

762
00:59:59,674 --> 01:00:02,507
A real man makes his own luck, 
Archie. Right, Dawson?

763
01:00:03,954 --> 01:00:07,662
And you find that sort of rootless 
existence appealing, do you?

764
01:00:10,593 --> 01:00:12,185
Yes, ma'am, I do.

765
01:00:12,793 --> 01:00:15,910
I mean, I've got everything I need
right here with me.

766
01:00:15,993 --> 01:00:19,303
I got air in my lungs
and a few blank sheets of paper.

767
01:00:19,913 --> 01:00:23,110
I love waking up in the morning
not knowing what's gonna happen ...

768
01:00:23,433 --> 01:00:25,230
or who I'm gonna meet ...

769
01:00:25,313 --> 01:00:27,031
where I'm gonna wind up.

770
01:00:27,113 --> 01:00:29,752
Just the other night I was sleeping
under a bridge, and now ...

771
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:31,983
here I am on the grandest 
ship in the world ...

772
01:00:32,073 --> 01:00:33,711
having champagne with you fine people.

773
01:00:33,793 --> 01:00:35,590
I'll take some more of that.

774
01:00:35,993 --> 01:00:39,507
I figure life is a gift
and I don't intend on wasting it.

775
01:00:39,953 --> 01:00:42,547
You never know what hand
you're gonna get dealt next.

776
01:00:42,632 --> 01:00:44,782
You learn to take life 
as it comes at you.

777
01:00:44,872 --> 01:00:46,385
Here you go, Cal.

778
01:00:47,792 --> 01:00:49,589
To make each day count.

779
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:52,388
- Well said, Jack.
- Hear, hear.

780
01:00:53,432 --> 01:00:55,150
To making it count.

781
01:00:56,312 --> 01:00:57,984
To making it count!

782
01:00:58,592 --> 01:00:59,741
Bravo.

783
01:01:05,872 --> 01:01:09,421
But Mr. Brown had no idea
I'd hidden the money in the stove.

784
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:14,585
So he comes home drunk as a pig,
celebrating, and he lights a fire.

785
01:01:17,151 --> 01:01:18,186
Bravo.

786
01:01:18,271 --> 01:01:20,910
Next it'll be brandies 
in the smoking room.

787
01:01:22,351 --> 01:01:25,343
- Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?
- What a good idea.

788
01:01:25,871 --> 01:01:29,022
Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke
and congratulate each other ...

789
01:01:29,111 --> 01:01:30,703
on being masters of the universe.

790
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:33,669
Ladies, thank you for the pleasure
of your company.

791
01:01:33,751 --> 01:01:35,309
Rose, may I escort you to the cabin?

792
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:37,063
No, I'll stay here.

793
01:01:37,271 --> 01:01:38,943
Here you go, Molly.

794
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:41,149
Joining us, Dawson?

795
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:44,427
You don't want to stay out here
with the women, do you?

796
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:47,786
- No, thanks, I've got to be heading back.
- Probably best.

797
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,259
It'll be all business and politics,
that sort of thing.

798
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:52,147
Wouldn't interest you.

799
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:53,709
But, Dawson ...

800
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:55,828
good of you to come.

801
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:01,703
Jack, must you go?

802
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:04,588
Time for me to go row
with the other slaves.

803
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:08,822
Good night, Rose.

804
01:02:47,188 --> 01:02:49,383
So you want to go to a real party?

805
01:02:59,588 --> 01:03:02,022
Is okay if I put my hand here? Okay.

806
01:03:16,548 --> 01:03:17,617
What?

807
01:03:20,227 --> 01:03:22,024
I can't understand you.

808
01:03:53,146 --> 01:03:55,580
I'm going to dance 
with her now, all right?

809
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:56,815
Come on.

810
01:03:56,906 --> 01:03:58,339
- What?
- Come on.

811
01:03:58,426 --> 01:04:00,735
- Come with me.
- Jack! Jack, wait.

812
01:04:03,346 --> 01:04:04,540
I can't do this.

813
01:04:04,626 --> 01:04:07,936
We're gonna have to get
a little bit closer, like this.

814
01:04:10,706 --> 01:04:12,981
You're still my best girl, Cora.

815
01:04:15,626 --> 01:04:18,777
- I don't know the steps.
- Neither do I, just go with it.

816
01:04:18,866 --> 01:04:20,219
Don't think.

817
01:04:38,505 --> 01:04:41,144
Wait, Jack! Stop!

818
01:04:50,504 --> 01:04:51,904
Stop! Wait!

819
01:05:31,623 --> 01:05:33,295
Jack, no.

820
01:05:39,023 --> 01:05:41,014
... beyond the jurisdiction
of the Sherman Act.

821
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,741
So my lawyers will argue.

822
01:05:42,823 --> 01:05:46,179
That's what Rockefeller said, but
the Supreme Court is not swallowing it.

823
01:06:05,582 --> 01:06:06,651
What?

824
01:06:06,742 --> 01:06:09,415
You think a first-class girl 
can't drink?

825
01:06:11,462 --> 01:06:12,975
Get out of here.

826
01:06:13,062 --> 01:06:14,620
You all right?

827
01:06:16,182 --> 01:06:17,297
I'm fine.

828
01:06:17,382 --> 01:06:18,940
2 out of 3.

829
01:06:20,342 --> 01:06:21,377
So ...

830
01:06:22,622 --> 01:06:24,852
you think you're big tough men?

831
01:06:25,742 --> 01:06:27,538
Let's see you do this.

832
01:06:29,301 --> 01:06:31,690
Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.

833
01:06:48,821 --> 01:06:50,539
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

834
01:06:50,621 --> 01:06:53,658
- Are you all right?
- I haven't done that in years.

835
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:29,773
Coffee, sir?

836
01:07:39,299 --> 01:07:41,813
I had hoped you would come to me
last night.

837
01:07:42,979 --> 01:07:44,298
I was tired.

838
01:07:47,059 --> 01:07:50,369
Your exertions below decks were,
no doubt, exhausting.

839
01:07:52,299 --> 01:07:56,133
I see you had that undertaker
of a manservant follow me. How typical.

840
01:07:56,219 --> 01:07:59,973
You will never behave like that again,
Rose, do you understand?

841
01:08:02,218 --> 01:08:05,767
I'm not a foreman in one of 
your mills that you can command.

842
01:08:06,738 --> 01:08:08,296
I'm your fiancée.

843
01:08:10,898 --> 01:08:12,456
My fiancée!

844
01:08:12,778 --> 01:08:14,689
Yes, you are, and my wife!

845
01:08:15,338 --> 01:08:19,377
My wife in practice, if not yet 
by law. So you will honor me.

846
01:08:19,858 --> 01:08:22,850
You'll honor me the way a wife 
is required to honor her husband.

847
01:08:22,938 --> 01:08:25,657
Because I will not be made
out a fool, Rose.

848
01:08:25,738 --> 01:08:27,729
Is this in any way unclear?

849
01:08:28,498 --> 01:08:29,487
No.

850
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:32,173
Good. Excuse me.

851
01:08:37,577 --> 01:08:38,852
Miss Rose.

852
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:43,177
- We had a little accident.
- That's all right, Miss Rose.

853
01:08:43,257 --> 01:08:44,849
- Sorry, Trudy.
- It's all right.

854
01:08:44,937 --> 01:08:46,211
Let me help you.

855
01:08:46,297 --> 01:08:48,015
It's all right, miss.

856
01:08:53,817 --> 01:08:55,216
It's all right, miss.

857
01:09:00,897 --> 01:09:03,286
- Tea, Trudy.
- Yes, ma'am.

858
01:09:18,816 --> 01:09:21,967
You are not to see that boy again.
Do you understand me?

859
01:09:23,136 --> 01:09:25,411
Rose, I forbid it.

860
01:09:26,376 --> 01:09:29,493
Stop it, Mother.
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

861
01:09:29,576 --> 01:09:31,248
This is not a game.

862
01:09:31,696 --> 01:09:33,766
Our situation is precarious.

863
01:09:33,856 --> 01:09:35,335
You know the money's gone.

864
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:37,452
Of course I know it's gone.

865
01:09:37,935 --> 01:09:39,813
You remind me every day.

866
01:09:40,535 --> 01:09:45,086
Your father left us nothing but a legacy
of bad debts hidden by a good name.

867
01:09:45,575 --> 01:09:48,294
That name is the only card
we have to play.

868
01:09:48,775 --> 01:09:50,606
I don't understand you.

869
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:54,570
It is a fine match with Hockley.
It will ensure our survival.

870
01:09:56,135 --> 01:09:58,012
How can you put this on my shoulders?

871
01:09:58,095 --> 01:09:59,813
Why are you being so selfish?

872
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:01,487
I'm being selfish?

873
01:10:04,895 --> 01:10:07,773
Do you want to see me working
as a seamstress?

874
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,251
Is that what you want?

875
01:10:13,654 --> 01:10:16,248
To see our fine things 
sold at auction?

876
01:10:18,094 --> 01:10:20,483
Our memories scattered to the winds?

877
01:10:30,534 --> 01:10:32,092
It's so unfair.

878
01:10:33,694 --> 01:10:35,571
Of course it's unfair.

879
01:10:36,534 --> 01:10:37,853
We're women.

880
01:10:40,294 --> 01:10:42,330
Our choices are never easy.

- Hello, Mr. Andrews.
- Hello, Jack.

889
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:51,202
I just need to talk to somebody
for a second.

890
01:11:51,292 --> 01:11:54,647
- Sir, you're not supposed to be in here.
- I just need to speak to someone.

891
01:11:57,611 --> 01:11:59,522
I was just here last night,
you don't remember me?

892
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:00,646
No, I'm afraid I don't.

893
01:12:00,731 --> 01:12:03,199
- Now, you're gonna have to turn around.
- He'll tell you.

894
01:12:03,291 --> 01:12:04,644
I just need to talk —

895
01:12:04,731 --> 01:12:07,450
Mr. Hockley and Mrs. Dewitt Bukater ...

896
01:12:08,131 --> 01:12:10,725
continue to be appreciative
of your assistance.

897
01:12:11,051 --> 01:12:14,487
They asked me to give you this
in gratitude.

898
01:12:14,571 --> 01:12:16,243
I don't want your money. Please. 
I just —

899
01:12:16,331 --> 01:12:19,447
Also to remind you
that you hold a third-class ticket ...

900
01:12:19,531 --> 01:12:22,283
and that your presence here
is no longer appropriate.

901
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:24,406
Please, I just wanna speak 
to Rose for one second.

902
01:12:24,491 --> 01:12:28,199
Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson
gets back to where he belongs ...

903
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:30,167
and that he stays there.

904
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:32,521
Yes, sir. Come along, you.

905
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:37,529
♪ Hear us when we cry to Thee ♪

906
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:42,600
♪ For those in peril on the sea ♪

907
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,486
And why do you have
2 steering wheels?

908
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:48,004
- We really only use this near shore.
- Excuse me, sir.

909
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:50,650
Another ice warning.
This one is from the Noordam.

910
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:52,367
Thank you, Sparks.

911
01:12:54,209 --> 01:12:57,679
Not to worry.
Quite normal for this time of year.

912
01:12:58,249 --> 01:13:02,003
In fact, we're speeding up.
I've just ordered the last boilers lit.

913
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:09,006
Okay, son, wind it up tight
like I showed you. That's right.

914
01:13:09,089 --> 01:13:10,807
Okay, now, let it go.

915
01:13:16,689 --> 01:13:18,281
That's excellent.

916
01:13:22,288 --> 01:13:24,757
Mr. Andrews, forgive me ...

917
01:13:25,649 --> 01:13:27,525
I did the sum in my head ...

918
01:13:27,608 --> 01:13:31,396
and with the number of lifeboats
times the capacity you mentioned ...

919
01:13:31,488 --> 01:13:35,242
Forgive me, but it seems that there are
not enough for everyone aboard.

920
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:37,046
About half, actually.

921
01:13:37,768 --> 01:13:39,963
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?

922
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:42,437
In fact, I put in 
these new-type davits ...

923
01:13:42,528 --> 01:13:45,645
which can take an extra row of boats
inside this one.

924
01:13:45,728 --> 01:13:47,878
But it was thought, by some ...

925
01:13:47,968 --> 01:13:49,799
the deck would look too cluttered.

926
01:13:49,888 --> 01:13:51,560
So, I was overruled.

927
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:55,359
It's a waste of deck space as it is
in an unsinkable ship.

928
01:13:55,448 --> 01:13:57,244
Sleep soundly, young Rose.

929
01:13:57,328 --> 01:14:00,125
I have built you a good ship,
strong and true.

930
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:02,004
She's all the lifeboat you need.

931
01:14:02,087 --> 01:14:05,159
Keep heading aft.
The next stop will be the engine room.

932
01:14:05,247 --> 01:14:06,396
Come on.

933
01:14:11,367 --> 01:14:14,325
Jack, this is impossible. 
I can't see you.

934
01:14:14,407 --> 01:14:16,682
- I need to talk to you.
- No, Jack. No.

935
01:14:18,647 --> 01:14:20,558
Jack, I'm engaged.

936
01:14:21,847 --> 01:14:23,405
I'm marrying Cal.

937
01:14:24,327 --> 01:14:25,646
I love Cal.

938
01:14:29,326 --> 01:14:31,681
Rose, you're no picnic, all right?

939
01:14:31,766 --> 01:14:34,155
You're a spoiled little brat, even.

940
01:14:34,246 --> 01:14:37,079
But under that,
you're the most amazingly ...

941
01:14:37,646 --> 01:14:39,955
astounding, wonderful girl ...

942
01:14:40,566 --> 01:14:43,205
Woman that I've ever known and —

943
01:14:43,286 --> 01:14:45,481
- Jack, I —
- No, let me try to get this out.

944
01:14:45,566 --> 01:14:46,885
You're making ...

945
01:14:49,126 --> 01:14:52,004
I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.

946
01:14:52,086 --> 01:14:53,883
I've got $10 in my pocket.

947
01:14:53,966 --> 01:14:56,799
I have nothing to offer you
and I know that.

948
01:14:57,086 --> 01:14:58,485
I understand.

949
01:14:59,566 --> 01:15:01,442
But I'm too involved now.

950
01:15:01,525 --> 01:15:03,436
You jump, I jump, remember?

951
01:15:03,525 --> 01:15:06,801
I can't turn away without knowing
you'll be all right.

952
01:15:07,365 --> 01:15:09,196
That's all that I want.

953
01:15:10,165 --> 01:15:11,678
Well, I'm fine.

954
01:15:12,645 --> 01:15:14,556
I'll be fine. Really.

955
01:15:15,885 --> 01:15:17,034
Really?

956
01:15:18,885 --> 01:15:20,477
I don't think so.

957
01:15:21,685 --> 01:15:23,198
They have got you trapped, Rose.

958
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:25,276
And you're gonna die
if you don't break free.

959
01:15:25,365 --> 01:15:28,162
Maybe not right away,
because you're strong ...

960
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:32,673
but sooner or later, that fire 
that I love about you, Rose ...

961
01:15:32,765 --> 01:15:34,880
that fire's going to burn out.

962
01:15:39,844 --> 01:15:42,233
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.

963
01:15:43,564 --> 01:15:44,997
You're right.

964
01:15:46,084 --> 01:15:47,836
Only you can do that.

965
01:15:53,764 --> 01:15:56,278
I'm going back. Leave me alone.

966
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:11,280
Tell Lucile about the disaster 
you had with the stationers.

967
01:16:11,363 --> 01:16:14,002
Of course, the invitations had to be
sent back, twice.

968
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:16,961
- Oh, my dear.
- And the dreadful bridesmaids' gowns.

969
01:16:17,043 --> 01:16:19,477
Let me tell you,
what an odyssey that has been.

970
01:16:19,563 --> 01:16:23,272
Rose decided she wanted lavender.
She knows I detest the color.

971
01:16:23,363 --> 01:16:25,399
She did it to spite me.

972
01:16:25,483 --> 01:16:27,599
If only you'd come to me sooner.

973
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:29,913
Ruth saw some of my designs
in La Mode lllustrée ...

974
01:16:30,003 --> 01:16:31,152
they were for the trousseau ...

975
01:16:31,243 --> 01:16:34,235
of the Duchess of Marlborough's youngest
daughter. They were quite charming.

976
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:36,552
I think you'll agree, my dear,
that together ...

977
01:16:37,202 --> 01:16:39,921
we've created something 
of a phoenix from the ashes.

978
01:16:54,162 --> 01:16:55,515
Hello, Jack.

979
01:17:00,802 --> 01:17:02,394
I changed my mind.

980
01:17:08,322 --> 01:17:10,438
They said you might be up here —

981
01:17:12,121 --> 01:17:13,759
Give me your hand.

982
01:17:20,681 --> 01:17:22,399
Now close your eyes.

983
01:17:23,401 --> 01:17:24,550
Go on.

984
01:17:27,681 --> 01:17:29,034
Now step up.

985
01:17:32,961 --> 01:17:35,680
Now hold on to the railing.
Keep your eyes closed.

986
01:17:35,761 --> 01:17:37,479
- Don't peek.
- I'm not.

987
01:17:38,721 --> 01:17:40,552
Step up onto the rail.

988
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,590
Hold on. Hold on.

989
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,591
Keep your eyes closed.

990
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:51,753
- Do you trust me?
- I trust you.

991
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,233
All right, open your eyes.

992
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,069
I'm flying. Jack.

993
01:18:37,239 --> 01:18:40,834
♪ Come, Josephine, 
in my flying machine ♪

994
01:18:40,918 --> 01:18:45,673
♪ Going up she goes, up she goes ♪

995
01:19:31,557 --> 01:19:34,629
That was the last time Titanic
ever saw daylight.

996
01:19:35,477 --> 01:19:38,196
We're up to dusk, 
the night of the sinking.

997
01:19:38,437 --> 01:19:40,553
- 6 hours to go.
- Incredible.

998
01:19:40,757 --> 01:19:42,429
There's Smith, 
and he's standing there ...

999
01:19:42,517 --> 01:19:44,906
and he's got the iceberg warning
in his fucking hand.

1000
01:19:44,997 --> 01:19:47,749
Excuse me, his hand,
and he's ordering more speed.

1001
01:19:47,836 --> 01:19:50,555
26 years of experience working
against him.

1002
01:19:51,116 --> 01:19:55,234
He figures anything big enough to sink
the ship, they're gonna see in time to turn.

1003
01:19:55,316 --> 01:19:57,955
But the ship's too big
with too small a rudder.

1004
01:19:58,036 --> 01:20:00,106
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1005
01:20:00,596 --> 01:20:02,666
Everything he knows is wrong.

1006
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:18,346
It's quite proper, I assure you.
This is the sitting room.

1007
01:20:20,395 --> 01:20:22,545
- Will this light do?
- What?

1008
01:20:22,875 --> 01:20:25,025
Don't artists need good light?

1009
01:20:25,115 --> 01:20:28,790
That is true, but I'm not used to working
in such horrible conditions.

1010
01:20:29,915 --> 01:20:31,064
Monet!

1011
01:20:32,235 --> 01:20:34,351
- You know his work?
- Of course.

1012
01:20:34,795 --> 01:20:37,184
Look at his use of color here.
Isn't he great?

1013
01:20:37,275 --> 01:20:39,266
I know. It's extraordinary.

1014
01:20:41,395 --> 01:20:44,671
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

1015
01:20:45,075 --> 01:20:47,714
Should we be expecting him
anytime soon?

1016
01:20:48,395 --> 01:20:51,272
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.

1017
01:20:54,794 --> 01:20:57,513
That's nice. What is it, a sapphire?

1018
01:20:58,434 --> 01:21:01,392
A diamond. A very rare diamond.

1019
01:21:05,154 --> 01:21:08,669
Jack, I want you to draw me
like one of your French girls.

1020
01:21:09,034 --> 01:21:11,594
- Wearing this.
- All right.

1021
01:21:13,394 --> 01:21:14,986
Wearing only this.

1022
01:21:48,873 --> 01:21:50,545
The last thing I need ...

1023
01:21:50,632 --> 01:21:53,943
is another picture of me
looking like a porcelain doll.

1024
01:21:56,713 --> 01:21:58,623
As a paying customer ...

1025
01:22:00,312 --> 01:22:02,382
I expect to get what I want.

1026
01:22:19,552 --> 01:22:22,066
Over on the bed. The couch.

1027
01:22:30,511 --> 01:22:32,229
Lie down.

1028
01:22:36,071 --> 01:22:39,700
- Tell me when it looks right.
- Put your arm back the way it was.

1029
01:22:41,351 --> 01:22:44,707
Put that other arm up,
that hand right by your face there.

1030
01:22:46,111 --> 01:22:47,260
Right.

1031
01:22:47,871 --> 01:22:49,623
Now, head down.

1032
01:22:51,911 --> 01:22:54,027
Eyes to me, keep them on me.

1033
01:22:56,030 --> 01:22:57,783
And try to stay still.

1034
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:17,309
So serious.

1035
01:23:57,589 --> 01:24:00,422
I believe you are blushing, 
Mr. Big Artiste.

1036
01:24:04,709 --> 01:24:07,381
I can't imagine 
Monsieur Monet blushing.

1037
01:24:08,588 --> 01:24:10,260
He does landscapes.

1038
01:24:11,108 --> 01:24:13,383
- Just relax your face.
- Sorry.

1039
01:24:13,468 --> 01:24:14,787
No laughing.

1040
01:24:44,507 --> 01:24:47,021
My heart was pounding the whole time.

1041
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:51,097
It was the most erotic 
moment of my life ...

1042
01:24:54,787 --> 01:24:56,743
up until then, at least.

1043
01:24:57,867 --> 01:24:59,664
So what happened next?

1044
01:25:00,307 --> 01:25:02,775
You mean, did we do it?

1045
01:25:06,466 --> 01:25:08,138
Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.

1046
01:25:08,227 --> 01:25:10,263
Jack was very professional.

1047
01:25:17,626 --> 01:25:18,945
Thank you.

1048
01:25:26,946 --> 01:25:28,618
What are you doing?

1049
01:25:29,026 --> 01:25:31,779
Will you put this back 
in the safe for me?

1050
01:25:42,985 --> 01:25:45,021
- Gentlemen, would you excuse me?
- Sure.

1051
01:25:47,025 --> 01:25:49,414
None of the stewards have seen her.

1052
01:25:49,905 --> 01:25:52,260
This is absurd. It's a ship.

1053
01:25:52,345 --> 01:25:54,620
There's only so many places 
she could be.

1054
01:25:54,705 --> 01:25:56,297
Lovejoy, find her.

1055
01:26:13,265 --> 01:26:14,697
- Clear.
- Yes.

1056
01:26:15,904 --> 01:26:18,816
I don't think I've ever seen
such a flat calm.

1057
01:26:20,024 --> 01:26:23,175
Like a mill pond. 
Not a breath of wind.

1058
01:26:24,464 --> 01:26:27,103
It will make 
the 'bergs harder to see ...

1059
01:26:27,384 --> 01:26:29,818
with no breaking water at the base.

1060
01:26:40,704 --> 01:26:42,137
Well, I'm off.

1061
01:26:42,224 --> 01:26:44,943
Maintain speed and heading,
Mr. Lightoller.

1062
01:26:45,263 --> 01:26:46,458
Yes, sir.

1063
01:26:57,263 --> 01:26:58,855
It's getting cold.

1064
01:26:59,063 --> 01:27:00,974
- You look nice.
- Miss Rose?

1065
01:27:02,023 --> 01:27:03,342
My drawings.

1066
01:27:28,382 --> 01:27:29,576
Come on, Jack!

1067
01:27:32,982 --> 01:27:34,859
- Wait!
- Wait!

1068
01:27:35,942 --> 01:27:38,058
- Go!
- Take us down, quick.

1069
01:27:38,142 --> 01:27:39,575
- Go!
- Quickly! Quickly!

1070
01:27:44,742 --> 01:27:45,776
Bye.

1071
01:27:53,261 --> 01:27:54,250
Sorry.

1072
01:27:59,581 --> 01:28:01,572
- Keep going.
- Thank you, I've got it.

1073
01:28:11,381 --> 01:28:13,895
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.

1074
01:28:13,981 --> 01:28:16,541
- Seems more like a cop.
- I think he was.

1075
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:18,659
- Oh, shit.
- Go!

1076
01:28:23,181 --> 01:28:25,614
- No, over here!
- Quick!

1077
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:34,695
- Now what?
- What?

1078
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:43,288
More coal for number one, mate.

1079
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:45,530
What are you two doing down here?

1080
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:47,895
You shouldn't be down here.
It could be dangerous!

1081
01:28:51,579 --> 01:28:53,774
Carry on. Don't mind us.

1082
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:56,817
You're doing a great job.
Keep up the good work!

1083
01:29:12,019 --> 01:29:14,010
Look at what we have here.

1084
01:29:31,578 --> 01:29:32,806
Thank you.

1085
01:29:43,978 --> 01:29:45,457
Where to, miss?

1086
01:29:46,818 --> 01:29:48,251
To the stars.

1087
01:30:06,497 --> 01:30:07,850
You nervous?

1088
01:30:10,217 --> 01:30:11,252
No.

1089
01:30:27,497 --> 01:30:29,533
Put your hands on me, Jack.

1090
01:30:53,216 --> 01:30:54,729
It's bloody cold.

1091
01:30:54,816 --> 01:30:57,488
You know, I can smell ice, you know.
When it's near.

1092
01:30:59,455 --> 01:31:01,969
- Bollocks!
- Well, I can, all right?

1093
01:31:02,895 --> 01:31:05,125
Did you ever find those binoculars
for the lookouts?

1094
01:31:05,215 --> 01:31:07,649
Haven't seen them since Southampton.

1095
01:31:07,735 --> 01:31:10,124
Well, I'll be on my rounds. Cheerio.

1096
01:31:40,534 --> 01:31:42,126
You're trembling.

1097
01:31:43,974 --> 01:31:46,613
Don't worry, I'll be all right.

1098
01:32:07,733 --> 01:32:10,008
- They ran down there.
- All right.

1099
01:32:18,813 --> 01:32:20,371
Anything missing?

1100
01:32:44,212 --> 01:32:46,123
I've got a better idea.

1101
01:32:58,412 --> 01:32:59,401
Gotcha!

1102
01:33:08,332 --> 01:33:10,447
Did you see those guys' faces?

1103
01:33:11,611 --> 01:33:13,169
Did you see them?

1104
01:33:19,491 --> 01:33:21,322
When the ship docks ...

1105
01:33:22,611 --> 01:33:24,567
I'm getting off with you.

1106
01:33:25,371 --> 01:33:27,248
- This is crazy.
- I know.

1107
01:33:27,331 --> 01:33:29,242
It doesn't make any sense.

1108
01:33:30,731 --> 01:33:32,527
That's why I trust it.

1109
01:33:41,970 --> 01:33:43,642
Here, look at this.

1110
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:46,241
Look at that, would you?

1111
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:48,321
They're a bit warmer than we are.

1112
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:50,844
If that's what it takes for us
to get warm, I'd rather not ...

1113
01:33:50,930 --> 01:33:52,727
if it's all the same to you, all right?

1114
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:06,241
Bugger me!

1115
01:34:10,889 --> 01:34:12,686
Pick up, you bastards!

1116
01:34:15,849 --> 01:34:18,079
- Is anyone there?
- Yes, what do you see?

1117
01:34:18,169 --> 01:34:20,478
- Iceberg, right ahead!
- Thank you.

1118
01:34:23,009 --> 01:34:24,328
Iceberg, right ahead!

1119
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:26,081
Hard to starboard!

1120
01:34:32,929 --> 01:34:35,318
Turn! Smartly!

1121
01:34:39,929 --> 01:34:41,282
Full astern!

1122
01:34:43,368 --> 01:34:45,723
- Hard over.
- Helm's hard over, sir.

1123
01:34:49,368 --> 01:34:50,801
Go, lads, go!

1124
01:34:53,448 --> 01:34:55,962
Bring that steam down! 
Bring it down!

1125
01:34:57,848 --> 01:35:00,237
Shut all the dampers! Shut them!

1126
01:35:04,808 --> 01:35:06,036
Hold it.

1127
01:35:10,048 --> 01:35:12,322
Now! Engage the reversing engine.

1128
01:35:39,647 --> 01:35:41,443
Why ain't they turning?

1129
01:35:41,527 --> 01:35:44,404
- Is it hard over?
- It is. Yes, sir, hard over.

1130
01:35:49,446 --> 01:35:52,563
Come on. Come on. Turn.

1131
01:36:03,046 --> 01:36:04,035
Yes.

1132
01:36:09,406 --> 01:36:10,885
It's gonna hit!

1133
01:36:21,885 --> 01:36:23,284
Jesus Christ!

1134
01:36:43,205 --> 01:36:44,558
Jesus.

1135
01:36:44,645 --> 01:36:47,079
- Hard to port!
- Hard to port!

1136
01:36:56,724 --> 01:36:57,918
Get back!

1137
01:37:25,923 --> 01:37:27,356
Come on, let's go!

1138
01:37:27,443 --> 01:37:29,877
Get out of the door.
They're closing the doors!

1139
01:37:29,963 --> 01:37:31,157
Get out!

1140
01:37:37,043 --> 01:37:39,238
Get out of the door! Go!

1141
01:37:40,123 --> 01:37:42,842
Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!

1142
01:37:54,763 --> 01:37:55,797
Out!

1143
01:38:09,882 --> 01:38:11,156
Oh, my God.

1144
01:38:12,482 --> 01:38:14,074
That was a close shave, wasn't it?

1145
01:38:14,162 --> 01:38:16,596
Smell ice, can you? Bleeding Christ!

1146
01:38:20,922 --> 01:38:23,436
Note the time and enter it in the log.

1147
01:38:28,961 --> 01:38:30,997
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

1148
01:38:31,481 --> 01:38:33,039
An iceberg, sir.

1149
01:38:33,881 --> 01:38:37,635
I put her hard to starboard, and ran the
engines full astern, but it was too close.

1150
01:38:37,721 --> 01:38:39,916
I tried to port round it, but she hit.

1151
01:38:40,001 --> 01:38:43,152
- Close the watertight doors.
- Doors are closed, sir.

1152
01:38:45,841 --> 01:38:47,559
- All stop.
- Aye, sir.

1153
01:38:55,681 --> 01:38:57,672
Find the carpenter.
Get him to sound the ship.

1154
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:58,954
Yes, sir.

1155
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,396
Come on, let's get the hell 
out of here.

1156
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:12,515
Come on, hurry up.

1157
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:19,157
Excuse me,
why have the engines stopped?

1158
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:21,231
- I felt a shudder.
- I shouldn't worry, madam.

1159
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:24,232
We've likely thrown a propeller blade.
That's the shudder you felt.

1160
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:26,117
May I bring you anything?

1161
01:39:26,199 --> 01:39:27,268
No, thank you.

1162
01:39:32,359 --> 01:39:34,634
So, now there's talk of an iceberg.
Did you see anything?

1163
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,516
I don't see anything now. Do you?

1164
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:41,470
If this is the direction the rats 
are going, that's good enough for me.

1165
01:39:44,359 --> 01:39:46,350
Everything's under control.

1166
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:50,195
- You there.
- Sir, there is no emergency.

1167
01:39:50,279 --> 01:39:51,917
Yes, there is. I've been robbed.

1168
01:39:51,999 --> 01:39:53,478
Get the master-at-arms.

1169
01:39:53,559 --> 01:39:55,436
- Now, you moron!
- Yes, sir.

1170
01:39:58,559 --> 01:40:00,435
Hey, did I miss the fun?

1171
01:40:01,918 --> 01:40:03,874
- Did you see what happened?
- No, I missed it.

1172
01:40:03,959 --> 01:40:06,075
Apparently, it hit over there.

1173
01:40:06,278 --> 01:40:08,838
Boiler Room 6 is flooded
8 feet above the plate ...

1174
01:40:08,918 --> 01:40:10,954
and the mail hold is worse.
She's all buckled in —

1175
01:40:11,038 --> 01:40:13,108
- Can you shore up?
- Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1176
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:14,870
Have you seen the damage
in the mail hold?

1177
01:40:14,958 --> 01:40:17,074
No, she's already underwater.

1178
01:40:17,158 --> 01:40:18,511
This is bad.

1179
01:40:20,718 --> 01:40:22,390
We should tell Mother and Cal.

1180
01:40:23,478 --> 01:40:25,673
I think they're very good, sir.

1181
01:40:28,238 --> 01:40:31,708
Don't touch anything.
I want the entire room photographed.

1182
01:40:36,077 --> 01:40:38,352
We've been looking for you, miss.

1183
01:40:42,477 --> 01:40:43,546
Here we go.

1184
01:40:49,477 --> 01:40:51,672
Something serious has happened.

1185
01:40:52,237 --> 01:40:53,636
Yes, it has.

1186
01:40:54,957 --> 01:40:55,992
Indeed.

1187
01:40:56,077 --> 01:40:58,386
Two things dear to me
have disappeared this evening.

1188
01:40:58,477 --> 01:41:01,593
Now that one is back, I have a pretty 
good idea where to find the other.

1189
01:41:01,677 --> 01:41:02,711
Search him.

1190
01:41:02,797 --> 01:41:04,388
- Take your coat off, son.
- Now what?

1191
01:41:04,477 --> 01:41:05,704
Come on, now.

1192
01:41:05,796 --> 01:41:07,594
Cal, what are you doing?

1193
01:41:07,676 --> 01:41:09,906
We're in the middle of an emergency.
What's going on?

1194
01:41:09,996 --> 01:41:12,066
- Is this it?
- That's it.

1195
01:41:12,676 --> 01:41:14,268
This is horseshit!

1196
01:41:15,116 --> 01:41:16,868
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't.

1197
01:41:16,956 --> 01:41:18,867
- He couldn't have.
- Of course he could.

1198
01:41:18,956 --> 01:41:20,548
It's easy enough for a professional.

1199
01:41:20,636 --> 01:41:23,275
But I was with him the whole time.
This is absurd.

1200
01:41:23,356 --> 01:41:27,315
Perhaps he did it while you were putting
your clothes back on, dear.

1201
01:41:27,716 --> 01:41:29,866
Real slick, Cal.
Rose, they put it in my pocket.

1202
01:41:29,956 --> 01:41:32,868
- Shut up.
- It isn't even your pocket. Is it, son?

1203
01:41:32,955 --> 01:41:34,947
"Property of A.L. Ryerson."

1204
01:41:38,555 --> 01:41:39,955
That was reported stolen today.

1205
01:41:40,035 --> 01:41:41,866
I just borrowed it. 
I was gonna return it.

1206
01:41:41,955 --> 01:41:44,344
An honest thief.
We have an honest thief here, do we?

1207
01:41:44,435 --> 01:41:47,233
You know I didn't do this, Rose.
You know it.

1208
01:41:47,395 --> 01:41:49,033
Don't believe them, Rose. You know it.

1209
01:41:49,115 --> 01:41:51,948
- You know I didn't do it.
- Come on, son. Let's go.

1210
01:41:52,035 --> 01:41:54,424
- Rose!
- Come on, there's a good lad.

1211
01:41:54,915 --> 01:41:56,030
Come on.

1212
01:41:56,115 --> 01:41:58,310
You know I didn't do it. You know me!

1213
01:41:59,555 --> 01:42:01,511
This is most unfortunate, Captain.

1214
01:42:05,394 --> 01:42:08,466
Water 14 feet above the keel
in 10 minutes ...

1215
01:42:09,154 --> 01:42:12,306
in the forepeak, in all 3 holds,
and in Boiler Room 6.

1216
01:42:12,394 --> 01:42:15,227
- That's right, sir.
- When can we get underway, damn it?

1217
01:42:15,314 --> 01:42:17,270
That's 5 compartments.

1218
01:42:18,914 --> 01:42:21,428
She can stay afloat with the 
first 4 compartments breached ...

1219
01:42:21,514 --> 01:42:22,913
but not 5.

1220
01:42:23,354 --> 01:42:24,548
Not 5.

1221
01:42:24,754 --> 01:42:26,267
As she goes down by the head ...

1222
01:42:26,354 --> 01:42:29,505
the water will spill over the tops 
of the bulkheads at "E" deck ...

1223
01:42:29,834 --> 01:42:32,143
from one to the next, back and back.

1224
01:42:32,314 --> 01:42:34,111
There's no stopping it.

1225
01:42:34,194 --> 01:42:35,513
The pumps. We open the pumps ...

1226
01:42:35,594 --> 01:42:38,267
The pumps buy you time,
but minutes only.

1227
01:42:39,313 --> 01:42:41,589
From this moment,
no matter what we do ...

1228
01:42:42,353 --> 01:42:44,071
Titanic will founder.

1229
01:42:46,673 --> 01:42:48,072
But this ship can't sink.

1230
01:42:48,153 --> 01:42:51,941
She's made of iron, sir.
I assure you, she can. And she will.

1231
01:42:53,033 --> 01:42:54,910
It is a mathematical certainty.

1232
01:42:59,393 --> 01:43:00,826
How much time?

1233
01:43:07,992 --> 01:43:10,188
An hour. Two, at most.

1234
01:43:16,232 --> 01:43:18,541
And how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?

1235
01:43:18,712 --> 01:43:20,942
2,200 souls on board, sir.

1236
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:30,910
Well, I believe you may 
get your headlines, Mr. Ismay.

1237
01:43:48,110 --> 01:43:50,340
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?

1238
01:43:51,070 --> 01:43:53,061
You look at me 
when I'm talking to you!

1239
01:43:53,230 --> 01:43:55,347
- Mr. Hockley?
- Not now. We're busy.

1240
01:43:55,431 --> 01:43:58,150
Sir, I've been told to ask you
to put on your lifebelts ...

1241
01:43:58,231 --> 01:44:00,222
and come up to the boat deck.
- I said, not now.

1242
01:44:00,311 --> 01:44:03,303
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,
Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.

1243
01:44:03,391 --> 01:44:05,269
Now please, dress warmly.

1244
01:44:05,552 --> 01:44:07,622
It's quite cold out tonight.

1245
01:44:07,992 --> 01:44:10,506
Now, may I suggest topcoats and hats?

1246
01:44:10,992 --> 01:44:12,664
This is ridiculous.

1247
01:44:13,352 --> 01:44:16,629
Not to worry, miss.
I'm sure it's just a precaution.

1248
01:44:17,073 --> 01:44:18,904
Everybody up. Lifebelts on.

1249
01:44:20,913 --> 01:44:22,631
What's he on about?

1250
01:44:22,713 --> 01:44:24,988
- Everybody up. Put your lifebelts on.
- What's the ruckus?

1251
01:44:25,073 --> 01:44:26,348
Just put your lifebelts on.

1252
01:44:27,794 --> 01:44:28,783
CQD?

1253
01:44:29,474 --> 01:44:30,543
Sir?

1254
01:44:32,074 --> 01:44:34,190
That's right, CQD, the distress call.

1255
01:44:34,674 --> 01:44:35,993
That's our position.

1256
01:44:41,195 --> 01:44:43,663
Tell whoever responds that we're 
going down by the head ...

1257
01:44:43,755 --> 01:44:45,632
and need immediate assistance.

1258
01:44:54,156 --> 01:44:55,350
Blimey.

1259
01:45:05,357 --> 01:45:06,676
Keep lowering!

1260
01:45:12,678 --> 01:45:16,273
Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!

1261
01:45:21,239 --> 01:45:24,390
Uncover this boat!
Uncover all the boats aft!

1262
01:45:24,479 --> 01:45:26,151
Release those ties!

1263
01:45:26,359 --> 01:45:29,112
Roll back that cover! Smartly now!

1264
01:45:29,639 --> 01:45:31,278
Mr. Wilde, where are the passengers?

1265
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:34,636
They've all gone back inside.
Too damn cold and noisy for them.

1266
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,755
You there!

1267
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:38,631
Get down here 
and help with these lines!

1268
01:45:52,562 --> 01:45:54,393
Care for a drink, sir?

1269
01:45:55,482 --> 01:45:56,756
Please put your lifebelts on.

1270
01:45:56,842 --> 01:45:58,514
Sonny, what's doing?

1271
01:45:58,642 --> 01:46:01,440
You got us all trussed up here
and now we're cooling our heels.

1272
01:46:01,522 --> 01:46:03,434
Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.

1273
01:46:04,283 --> 01:46:07,036
I don't think anybody knows
what the hell's going on around here.

1274
01:46:07,123 --> 01:46:09,876
It's just the goddamned English,
doing everything by the book.

1275
01:46:09,963 --> 01:46:12,682
There's no need 
for language, Mr. Hockley.

1276
01:46:12,923 --> 01:46:15,199
Go back and turn the heaters on
in our rooms.

1277
01:46:15,284 --> 01:46:17,081
I'd like a cup of tea when I return.

1278
01:46:17,164 --> 01:46:18,961
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

1279
01:46:28,165 --> 01:46:29,644
Mr. Andrews ...

1280
01:46:31,085 --> 01:46:33,997
I saw the iceberg.
And I see it in your eyes.

1281
01:46:34,365 --> 01:46:35,765
Please tell me the truth.

1282
01:46:44,006 --> 01:46:45,679
The ship will sink.

1283
01:46:47,327 --> 01:46:48,919
- You're certain?
- Yes.

1284
01:46:49,207 --> 01:46:50,879
In an hour or so ...

1285
01:46:51,647 --> 01:46:54,719
all this will be
at the bottom of the Atlantic.

1286
01:46:55,407 --> 01:46:56,443
What?

1287
01:46:56,528 --> 01:46:58,484
Please, tell only who you must.

1288
01:46:58,568 --> 01:47:00,718
I don't want to be 
responsible for a panic.

1289
01:47:00,888 --> 01:47:03,448
And get to a boat. 
Quickly. Don't wait.

1290
01:47:04,488 --> 01:47:07,322
You remember
what I told you about the boats?

1291
01:47:09,649 --> 01:47:10,684
Yes.

1292
01:47:12,569 --> 01:47:14,002
I understand.

1293
01:47:18,170 --> 01:47:20,479
Yes, madam, 
please put it on immediately.

1294
01:47:21,690 --> 01:47:23,169
Over here, son.

1295
01:47:24,010 --> 01:47:26,399
Sir, they need you up
at the second-class purser's office.

1296
01:47:26,490 --> 01:47:29,369
- There's a big mob up there.
- Go on. I'll keep an eye on him.

1297
01:47:29,891 --> 01:47:31,244
Aye. Right.

1298
01:47:44,612 --> 01:47:45,681
Sir!

1299
01:47:45,772 --> 01:47:48,127
Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.

1300
01:47:48,212 --> 01:47:50,089
Full steam for them, sir.

1301
01:47:51,373 --> 01:47:52,931
She's the only one who's responding?

1302
01:47:53,013 --> 01:47:54,412
The only one close, sir.

1303
01:47:54,493 --> 01:47:56,609
Says they can be here in 4 hours.

1304
01:47:57,133 --> 01:47:58,452
4 hours!

1305
01:48:03,574 --> 01:48:05,132
Thank you, Bride.

1306
01:48:09,454 --> 01:48:10,603
My God.

1307
01:48:19,855 --> 01:48:22,085
We are swung out and ready, sir.

1308
01:48:23,216 --> 01:48:26,413
Hadn't we better get the women
and children into the boats, sir?

1309
01:48:28,896 --> 01:48:30,011
Yes.

1310
01:48:30,096 --> 01:48:31,131
Sir?

1311
01:48:33,697 --> 01:48:36,894
Women and children first, yes.

1312
01:48:38,257 --> 01:48:39,485
Yes, sir.

1313
01:48:42,297 --> 01:48:45,335
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please!

1314
01:48:45,658 --> 01:48:47,888
Step this way, please. That's right.

1315
01:48:48,058 --> 01:48:50,367
Come towards me. Thank you.

1316
01:48:51,818 --> 01:48:52,887
Good.

1317
01:48:53,058 --> 01:48:56,938
For the time being, I shall 
require only women and children.

1318
01:48:57,219 --> 01:48:59,255
- Gentlemen, please.
- Right here.

1319
01:48:59,339 --> 01:49:02,968
All right, boys. Like the Captain said,
nice and cheery, so there's no panic.

1320
01:49:04,019 --> 01:49:05,578
Wedding Dance.

1321
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:15,655
Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.

1322
01:49:17,181 --> 01:49:18,819
Here, put your lifebelt on.

1323
01:49:18,901 --> 01:49:20,937
Yeah, come on. Put your lifebelt on.

1324
01:49:21,021 --> 01:49:22,579
Turn that around.

1325
01:49:23,621 --> 01:49:24,815
Please.

1326
01:49:26,781 --> 01:49:29,171
It isn't time to go up to the boats yet!

1327
01:49:29,542 --> 01:49:31,021
Please stay calm.

1328
01:49:31,102 --> 01:49:34,777
Make sure, everybody,
you've got your lifebelts on.

1329
01:49:34,862 --> 01:49:37,535
And, gentlemen, allow the women
and children through to the front.

1330
01:49:37,622 --> 01:49:39,932
- What are we doing, Mommy?
- We're just waiting, dear.

1331
01:49:40,023 --> 01:49:42,412
When they finish putting
first-class people in the boats ...

1332
01:49:42,503 --> 01:49:45,540
they will be starting with us
and we'll want to be all ready, won't we?

1333
01:49:45,623 --> 01:49:47,056
Everybody, not just right yet.

1334
01:49:47,143 --> 01:49:48,975
Don't push on the gates.
You won't get out any faster.

1335
01:49:49,064 --> 01:49:50,417
- Someone help.
- Go and get some help.

1336
01:49:50,504 --> 01:49:52,972
Lower it away, left and right together!

1337
01:49:55,144 --> 01:49:57,419
Both sides together! Steady!

1338
01:49:58,224 --> 01:49:59,419
Steady!

1339
01:50:02,465 --> 01:50:03,944
Stop!

1340
01:50:04,945 --> 01:50:06,617
Hold the left side!

1341
01:50:06,705 --> 01:50:08,900
Right side only!

1342
01:50:09,225 --> 01:50:11,535
Right side only. Hold the left side!

1343
01:50:12,906 --> 01:50:14,624
Lower away together!

1344
01:50:16,346 --> 01:50:17,779
Steady, lads!

1345
01:51:03,510 --> 01:51:06,469
You know, 
I do believe this ship may sink.

1346
01:51:08,951 --> 01:51:12,739
I've been asked to give you
this small token of our appreciation.

1347
01:51:15,632 --> 01:51:18,021
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

1348
01:51:24,712 --> 01:51:27,466
Come on, sister. You heard the man.
Into the boat.

1349
01:51:27,833 --> 01:51:29,630
Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen?

1350
01:51:29,713 --> 01:51:31,783
Only women at this time, sir.

1351
01:51:34,153 --> 01:51:36,952
Will the lifeboats be seated
according to class?

1352
01:51:38,354 --> 01:51:40,584
I hope they're not too crowded.

1353
01:51:41,674 --> 01:51:43,904
Oh, Mother, shut up!

1354
01:51:44,394 --> 01:51:45,873
Don't you understand?

1355
01:51:45,954 --> 01:51:48,230
The water is freezing
and there aren't enough boats.

1356
01:51:48,315 --> 01:51:49,953
Not enough by half.

1357
01:51:50,315 --> 01:51:52,545
Half the people on this ship
are going to die.

1358
01:51:52,835 --> 01:51:54,553
Not the better half.

1359
01:51:56,235 --> 01:52:00,070
Come on, Ruth, get in the boat.
First-class seats are right up here.

1360
01:52:00,756 --> 01:52:02,792
You know, it's a pity
I didn't keep that drawing.

1361
01:52:02,876 --> 01:52:04,753
It'll be worth a lot more by morning.

1362
01:52:04,836 --> 01:52:07,794
Women and children
towards the front, please.

1363
01:52:07,876 --> 01:52:10,266
You unimaginable bastard.

1364
01:52:11,197 --> 01:52:13,836
Come on, Rose, darling.
There's plenty of room for you.

1365
01:52:13,917 --> 01:52:15,032
Right this way, miss.

1366
01:52:15,117 --> 01:52:16,516
Come on, Rose.

1367
01:52:16,597 --> 01:52:18,315
You're next, darling.

1368
01:52:18,477 --> 01:52:20,389
Come into the boat, Rose.

1369
01:52:21,518 --> 01:52:22,587
Come.

1370
01:52:23,038 --> 01:52:24,107
Rose?

1371
01:52:25,158 --> 01:52:26,796
Get into the boat.

1372
01:52:27,118 --> 01:52:28,187
Rose?

1373
01:52:29,638 --> 01:52:31,197
Goodbye, Mother.

1374
01:52:32,799 --> 01:52:33,868
Rose?

1375
01:52:34,319 --> 01:52:36,708
- Rose, come back here.
- Where are you going?

1376
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:38,348
To him?

1377
01:52:38,479 --> 01:52:40,390
What, to be a whore to a gutter rat?

1378
01:52:40,479 --> 01:52:41,469
No, wait.

1379
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:44,199
I'd rather be his whore 
than your wife.

1380
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:48,189
No!

1381
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:50,113
I said, no!

1382
01:52:51,801 --> 01:52:53,712
Rose, please stop!

1383
01:52:55,401 --> 01:52:56,959
- Lower away!
- No, stop!

1384
01:52:57,041 --> 01:52:58,679
- All together.
- No, wait!

1385
01:52:58,761 --> 01:53:00,080
Lower away!

1386
01:53:00,241 --> 01:53:01,356
Rose!

1387
01:53:07,522 --> 01:53:08,591
Help!

1388
01:53:09,322 --> 01:53:11,313
Can anybody hear me?

1389
01:53:12,442 --> 01:53:14,320
Hello! Help me!

1390
01:53:24,124 --> 01:53:25,443
Mr. Andrews!

1391
01:53:28,724 --> 01:53:31,284
- Steward, check the starboard corridor.
- Yes, Mr. Andrews.

1392
01:53:31,364 --> 01:53:34,162
Madam, please, put on a lifebelt.
Get to the boat deck immediately.

1393
01:53:34,244 --> 01:53:36,805
Lucy, for God's sake, put on 
a lifebelt and set a good example.

1394
01:53:36,885 --> 01:53:38,113
Yes, sir.

1395
01:53:38,565 --> 01:53:40,760
- Anyone in here?
- Mr. Andrews?

1396
01:53:41,045 --> 01:53:42,080
Thank God.

1397
01:53:42,165 --> 01:53:44,725
Where would the master-at-arms
take someone under arrest?

1398
01:53:45,045 --> 01:53:47,480
- You have to get to a boat right away.
- No!

1399
01:53:47,566 --> 01:53:49,796
I'm doing this with or 
without your help, sir.

1400
01:53:49,886 --> 01:53:51,842
But without will take longer.

1401
01:53:53,126 --> 01:53:55,924
Take the elevator to the very bottom.
Go to the left.

1402
01:53:56,007 --> 01:53:59,556
Down the crewmen's passage, then 
go right and left again at the stairs.

1403
01:53:59,647 --> 01:54:01,080
You'll come to a long corridor.

1404
01:54:05,167 --> 01:54:06,806
This could be bad.

1405
01:54:10,928 --> 01:54:12,122
Oh, shit!

1406
01:54:18,729 --> 01:54:20,481
Excuse me. Thank you.

1407
01:54:21,849 --> 01:54:24,079
- I do not care what you think, sir.
- Lifts are closed.

1408
01:54:24,169 --> 01:54:26,922
I'm sorry, miss, 
but the lifts are closed.

1409
01:54:27,889 --> 01:54:31,360
I'm through being polite, 
God damn it! Now, take me down!

1410
01:54:33,050 --> 01:54:34,165
"E" deck.

1411
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:38,804
Come on.

1412
01:54:57,612 --> 01:54:59,250
- I'm going back up.
- No.

1413
01:55:04,733 --> 01:55:08,043
Come back! I'm going back up!

1414
01:55:16,374 --> 01:55:17,807
Crew passage.

1415
01:55:39,936 --> 01:55:41,051
Jack!

1416
01:55:53,377 --> 01:55:54,413
Rose!

1417
01:55:55,418 --> 01:55:56,407
Jack!

1418
01:55:56,498 --> 01:55:58,090
Rose, I'm in here!

1419
01:55:59,418 --> 01:56:00,407
Jack!

1420
01:56:01,418 --> 01:56:02,453
- Jack!
- Rose!

1421
01:56:02,538 --> 01:56:05,099
Jack! Jack, I'm sorry.

1422
01:56:05,659 --> 01:56:07,729
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1423
01:56:08,739 --> 01:56:12,254
- That guy, Lovejoy, put it in my pocket.
- I know. I know.

1424
01:56:12,339 --> 01:56:13,488
Listen, Rose ...

1425
01:56:13,579 --> 01:56:15,615
you're gonna have to find 
a spare key, all right?

1426
01:56:15,699 --> 01:56:17,691
Look in that cabinet right there.

1427
01:56:18,020 --> 01:56:20,250
It's a little silver one, Rose.

1428
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:22,129
Silver.

1429
01:56:22,740 --> 01:56:24,696
These are all brass ones!

1430
01:56:24,940 --> 01:56:26,772
Check right here, Rose.

1431
01:56:30,701 --> 01:56:31,895
Rose ...

1432
01:56:33,061 --> 01:56:35,131
how'd you find out I didn't do it?

1433
01:56:35,301 --> 01:56:38,021
I didn't. 
I just realized I already knew.

1434
01:56:40,542 --> 01:56:41,975
Keep looking.

1435
01:56:50,463 --> 01:56:52,897
No key. There's no key!

1436
01:56:52,983 --> 01:56:54,018
All right, Rose, listen.

1437
01:56:54,103 --> 01:56:56,094
You're gonna have to go 
find some help.

1438
01:56:56,583 --> 01:56:58,096
It'll be all right.

1439
01:57:02,264 --> 01:57:03,936
I'll be right back.

1440
01:57:11,105 --> 01:57:12,823
I'll just wait here!

1441
01:57:25,306 --> 01:57:27,376
Hello? Is there anyone here?

1442
01:57:27,786 --> 01:57:28,901
Hello?

1443
01:57:29,706 --> 01:57:31,777
Is there anybody down here?

1444
01:57:32,427 --> 01:57:34,145
We need help! Hello?

1445
01:57:35,907 --> 01:57:37,101
Damn it.

1446
01:57:42,828 --> 01:57:45,262
Can anybody hear me, please? Hello?

1447
01:57:48,508 --> 01:57:49,736
Oh, thank God.

1448
01:57:49,868 --> 01:57:52,986
Wait, I need your help.
There's a man back here.

1449
01:57:53,309 --> 01:57:54,298
Wait!

1450
01:57:58,309 --> 01:57:59,458
Hello?

1451
01:58:24,391 --> 01:58:25,541
Hello?

1452
01:58:26,352 --> 01:58:27,785
Miss, you shouldn't be here now.

1453
01:58:27,872 --> 01:58:30,306
- I need your help.
- We'll get you topside. This way, quickly.

1454
01:58:30,392 --> 01:58:31,791
There's a man down here. He's trapped.

1455
01:58:31,872 --> 01:58:34,147
- This way. There is no need to panic.
- Please!

1456
01:58:34,232 --> 01:58:36,906
No, I'm not panicking!
You're going the wrong way!

1457
01:58:37,193 --> 01:58:38,911
Let go of me! Listen!

1458
01:58:44,033 --> 01:58:45,625
The hell with you.

1459
01:59:21,557 --> 01:59:22,910
Oh, my God.

1460
02:00:09,361 --> 02:00:10,430
Jack!

1461
02:00:10,921 --> 02:00:11,990
Rose!

1462
02:00:13,082 --> 02:00:14,561
Will this work?

1463
02:00:15,482 --> 02:00:17,712
I guess we'll find out. Come on.

1464
02:00:21,082 --> 02:00:22,151
Wait.

1465
02:00:22,442 --> 02:00:24,399
Try a couple 
of practice swings over there.

1466
02:00:30,123 --> 02:00:33,832
Good. Now try to hit the same 
mark again, Rose. You can do it.

1467
02:00:39,444 --> 02:00:41,196
Okay. That's enough practice.

1468
02:00:41,524 --> 02:00:43,116
Come on, Rose. You can do it.

1469
02:00:43,924 --> 02:00:46,962
Listen, just hit it really hard
and really fast.

1470
02:00:48,885 --> 02:00:50,238
Come on. Wait.

1471
02:00:50,365 --> 02:00:51,957
Open your hands up a little more.

1472
02:00:52,045 --> 02:00:53,114
- Good.
- Like that?

1473
02:00:53,205 --> 02:00:54,354
Right.

1474
02:00:54,605 --> 02:00:56,562
Listen, Rose, I trust you.

1475
02:01:01,366 --> 02:01:02,355
Go.

1476
02:01:08,167 --> 02:01:09,316
You did it!

1477
02:01:09,687 --> 02:01:11,245
Come on, let's go.

1478
02:01:11,367 --> 02:01:13,198
Oh, shit, this is cold!

1479
02:01:21,088 --> 02:01:22,806
This is the way out.

1480
02:01:23,008 --> 02:01:25,476
We have to find another way. 
Come on.

1481
02:01:39,050 --> 02:01:41,484
Now there's something
you don't see every day.

1482
02:02:02,771 --> 02:02:06,047
What's this luggage doing here?
Get rid of it. We need the room.

1483
02:02:06,131 --> 02:02:07,689
Get rid of that! Out!

1484
02:02:08,091 --> 02:02:11,129
Come. Time for her to go, sir. 
Step back.

1485
02:02:11,212 --> 02:02:13,362
- Keep calm. Sit down.
- No.

1486
02:02:13,652 --> 02:02:16,007
- No!
- Make more room.

1487
02:02:17,052 --> 02:02:18,724
That's right. Look sharp.

1488
02:02:19,612 --> 02:02:20,761
Lovejoy.

1489
02:02:20,852 --> 02:02:22,969
She's not on the starboard side, either.

1490
02:02:23,253 --> 02:02:24,402
We're running out of time.

1491
02:02:24,493 --> 02:02:27,530
This strutting martinet
isn't letting any men on at all.

1492
02:02:27,773 --> 02:02:30,241
There's one on the other side
letting men on.

1493
02:02:30,333 --> 02:02:31,766
Then that's our play.

1494
02:02:32,013 --> 02:02:34,653
We'll need some insurance first. 
Come on.

1495
02:02:34,734 --> 02:02:37,407
Come on, this way, please.
All the way down there.

1496
02:02:39,854 --> 02:02:40,923
Here!

1497
02:02:41,694 --> 02:02:43,890
What do you think you're doing?

1498
02:02:43,975 --> 02:02:46,045
You'll have to pay for that, you know.

1499
02:02:46,175 --> 02:02:48,894
- That's White Star Line property.
- Shut up!

1500
02:02:50,535 --> 02:02:54,006
Will you hold the boat a moment?
I just have to run back to my room ...

1501
02:02:54,096 --> 02:02:57,054
- Sit down.
- She's the last.

1502
02:02:57,136 --> 02:03:00,890
Mr. Lightoller, why are the boats 
being launched half-full?

1503
02:03:00,976 --> 02:03:02,648
- Not now, Mr. Andrews.
- There, look.

1504
02:03:02,776 --> 02:03:05,291
20 or so in a boat built for 65?

1505
02:03:05,377 --> 02:03:07,732
And I saw one boat with only 12. 12!

1506
02:03:07,817 --> 02:03:10,536
We weren't sure of the weight,
Mr. Andrews.

1507
02:03:10,617 --> 02:03:12,847
- These boats may buckle.
- Rubbish!

1508
02:03:13,057 --> 02:03:15,618
They were tested in Belfast
with the weight of 70 men.

1509
02:03:15,698 --> 02:03:18,656
Now fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller.
For God's sake, man!

1510
02:03:25,498 --> 02:03:28,297
Please, I need more 
women and children!

1511
02:03:32,939 --> 02:03:35,294
Get back in there! 
This is not an exit.

1512
02:03:35,379 --> 02:03:36,938
Get back in there.

1513
02:03:39,460 --> 02:03:43,135
You can't keep us locked in here
like animals. The ship's bloody sinking.

1514
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:45,256
Bring forward the women.

1515
02:03:45,340 --> 02:03:47,296
Unlock the gates.

1516
02:03:47,660 --> 02:03:49,299
Women only!

1517
02:04:02,222 --> 02:04:03,735
Lock the gates!

1518
02:04:11,823 --> 02:04:14,860
For God's sake, man, there are
women and children down here!

1519
02:04:14,983 --> 02:04:17,577
Let us up, so we can have a chance!

1520
02:04:17,863 --> 02:04:19,091
Get back!

1521
02:04:22,424 --> 02:04:23,698
- Jack.
- Tommy.

1522
02:04:23,784 --> 02:04:25,581
- Can we get out?
- It's hopeless that way.

1523
02:04:25,664 --> 02:04:27,700
Whatever we do, 
we've got to do it fast.

1524
02:04:27,824 --> 02:04:29,018
Jack!

1525
02:04:29,104 --> 02:04:30,332
Fabrizio.

1526
02:04:30,785 --> 02:04:32,059
The boats are all gone.

1527
02:04:32,145 --> 02:04:34,101
This whole place is flooding.
We've got to get out.

1528
02:04:34,185 --> 02:04:36,062
- There is niente this way.
- All right.

1529
02:04:36,185 --> 02:04:37,857
Let's go this way, 
all right? Come on.

1530
02:04:43,426 --> 02:04:45,701
- I make my own luck.
- So do I.

1531
02:04:53,547 --> 02:04:54,741
Come on!

1532
02:04:55,387 --> 02:04:56,900
No, come on, let's go this way.

1533
02:05:05,828 --> 02:05:07,102
This way.

1534
02:05:07,188 --> 02:05:11,306
Just go back to the main stairwell
and everything will be sorted out there.

1535
02:05:11,388 --> 02:05:12,377
The hell it will.

1536
02:05:12,708 --> 02:05:15,985
It will all get sorted out back there.
Go back to the main stairwell.

1537
02:05:16,109 --> 02:05:18,100
- Open the gate.
- Go back down the main stairwell.

1538
02:05:18,189 --> 02:05:19,178
Open the gate right now.

1539
02:05:19,269 --> 02:05:21,624
Go back down the main stairwell
like I told you!

1540
02:05:23,749 --> 02:05:26,344
God damn it! Son of a bitch!

1541
02:05:26,510 --> 02:05:27,784
Stop that!

1542
02:05:27,950 --> 02:05:29,702
Open the damn gate!

1543
02:05:32,270 --> 02:05:33,464
Fabri, Tommy, give me hand here.

1544
02:05:33,550 --> 02:05:35,701
- Move aside. Move aside!
- Pull!

1545
02:05:36,791 --> 02:05:37,860
Pull!

1546
02:05:38,591 --> 02:05:40,741
- Move aside.
- Put that down!

1547
02:05:40,831 --> 02:05:42,469
- Move aside!
- Put that down!

1548
02:05:42,551 --> 02:05:44,587
- One! Two!
- Stop that!

1549
02:05:44,791 --> 02:05:45,780
Three!

1550
02:05:47,912 --> 02:05:48,901
Again!

1551
02:05:51,032 --> 02:05:52,260
Let's go!

1552
02:05:54,192 --> 02:05:55,227
Let's go, Rose.

1553
02:05:55,312 --> 02:05:57,508
You can't go up there! 
You can't do this!

1554
02:06:03,913 --> 02:06:05,585
Keep order here!

1555
02:06:05,673 --> 02:06:07,790
Get back. Get back!

1556
02:06:12,674 --> 02:06:14,153
Hold on to her!

1557
02:06:15,114 --> 02:06:16,263
Pull her in.

1558
02:06:16,914 --> 02:06:18,985
Get back, I say ...

1559
02:06:19,195 --> 02:06:21,663
or I'll shoot you all like dogs!

1560
02:06:21,755 --> 02:06:22,983
Keep order here!

1561
02:06:24,555 --> 02:06:26,068
Keep order, I say.

1562
02:06:27,635 --> 02:06:29,513
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.

1563
02:06:33,756 --> 02:06:34,825
Right.

1564
02:06:34,916 --> 02:06:37,669
Is everybody all right? Nobody panic.

1565
02:06:43,757 --> 02:06:44,985
Stay back!

1566
02:06:45,677 --> 02:06:46,826
We're too late.

1567
02:06:46,917 --> 02:06:48,794
There are more boats down the front.

1568
02:06:48,877 --> 02:06:51,915
Stay with this one. Murdoch.
He seems to be quite practical.

1569
02:06:53,838 --> 02:06:55,317
Stop lowering!

1570
02:06:56,438 --> 02:06:57,666
Stop lowering!

1571
02:06:57,998 --> 02:06:59,317
Cut the falls!

1572
02:07:05,999 --> 02:07:07,318
Sit down!

1573
02:07:08,359 --> 02:07:10,748
Stay back, you lot! Just stay back!

1574
02:07:10,959 --> 02:07:13,394
Stay back, the lot of you! 
Just stay back!

1575
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:18,480
It's starting to fall apart.
We don't have much time.

1576
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:21,114
Mr. Murdoch?

1577
02:07:21,240 --> 02:07:23,914
Mr. Hockley. You two, with me, now!

1578
02:07:24,241 --> 02:07:27,438
I'm a businessman, as you know,
I have a business proposition for you.

1579
02:07:34,842 --> 02:07:35,991
Come on, Rose.

1580
02:07:39,282 --> 02:07:41,034
The boats are gone!

1581
02:07:45,683 --> 02:07:47,275
Colonel, are there any boats 
on that side?

1582
02:07:47,363 --> 02:07:49,752
No, miss, but there are a couple 
of boats all the way forward.

1583
02:07:49,843 --> 02:07:51,401
This way, I'll lead you.

1584
02:07:57,404 --> 02:08:00,077
What's the use?
Nobody's listening to us anyway.

1585
02:08:00,604 --> 02:08:04,392
They don't listen to us at dinner, either.
Come on, let's play. Keep us warm.

1586
02:08:05,764 --> 02:08:06,880
Orpheus.

1587
02:08:11,645 --> 02:08:14,478
Music to drown by.
Now I know I'm in first class.

1588
02:08:19,526 --> 02:08:22,484
- Where is everyone?
- They're all still aft, sir.

1589
02:08:22,686 --> 02:08:24,165
Come on, madam, don't cry.

1590
02:08:24,886 --> 02:08:27,081
We have an understanding, 
then, Mr. Murdoch.

1591
02:08:37,767 --> 02:08:41,556
Will the men please hold back?
Hold back, I say!

1592
02:08:44,128 --> 02:08:47,677
Women and children only! Get back!

1593
02:08:48,128 --> 02:08:50,199
I said, step back, sir.
Come through, madam.

1594
02:08:50,289 --> 02:08:52,086
This way. Step back, sir!

1595
02:08:52,169 --> 02:08:53,158
Let the women —

1596
02:08:53,249 --> 02:08:55,285
You better check the other side. Go!

1597
02:09:02,810 --> 02:09:06,325
I found her, on the other side.
Waiting for a boat ...

1598
02:09:06,970 --> 02:09:08,119
with him.

1599
02:09:09,290 --> 02:09:11,930
- Any more women and children?
- They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.

1600
02:09:12,011 --> 02:09:13,524
Anyone else then?

1601
02:09:14,491 --> 02:09:15,844
- Hop on, sir.
- Anyone else?

1602
02:09:15,931 --> 02:09:17,762
Do hurry. Hurry along.

1603
02:09:20,971 --> 02:09:22,325
Stand by the falls.

1604
02:09:22,412 --> 02:09:24,209
God damn it all to hell.

1605
02:09:26,692 --> 02:09:27,727
Shit.

1606
02:09:27,812 --> 02:09:28,801
Fire!

1607
02:09:29,932 --> 02:09:32,128
Sir, you can't go through here.

1608
02:09:32,493 --> 02:09:34,290
Sir, you can't go through.

1609
02:09:36,053 --> 02:09:38,009
That's it. Splendid. Right.

1610
02:09:42,213 --> 02:09:43,567
Prepare to lower!

1611
02:09:45,814 --> 02:09:47,406
Ready on the left!

1612
02:09:53,254 --> 02:09:54,574
Take them down.

1613
02:09:59,415 --> 02:10:00,689
Keep it steady.

1614
02:10:03,135 --> 02:10:06,446
Both sides together.
Steady. Keep it steady.

1615
02:10:07,976 --> 02:10:10,046
- Give her to me.
- Daddy.

1616
02:10:10,336 --> 02:10:12,896
- It'll be fine, darling. Don't you worry.
- Take her.

1617
02:10:12,976 --> 02:10:14,694
Daddy, get in the boat.

1618
02:10:14,776 --> 02:10:18,087
It's goodbye for a little while.
Only for a little while.

1619
02:10:18,177 --> 02:10:19,815
There'll be another 
boat for the daddies ...

1620
02:10:19,897 --> 02:10:21,569
this boat's for the mommies
and the children.

1621
02:10:21,657 --> 02:10:24,410
You hold Mommy's hand
and be a good little girl.

1622
02:10:25,097 --> 02:10:26,292
I'm not going without you.

1623
02:10:26,378 --> 02:10:28,687
- No. You have to go, now.
- No, Jack.

1624
02:10:29,018 --> 02:10:30,576
Get in the boat, Rose.

1625
02:10:30,658 --> 02:10:31,647
No, Jack.

1626
02:10:31,738 --> 02:10:33,456
Yes. Get on the boat.

1627
02:10:33,658 --> 02:10:35,535
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.

1628
02:10:38,619 --> 02:10:41,258
My God. Look at you. 
You look a fright.

1629
02:10:41,779 --> 02:10:42,814
Here.

1630
02:10:44,419 --> 02:10:46,455
Put this on. Come on.

1631
02:10:51,780 --> 02:10:53,611
Go on. I'll get the next one.

1632
02:10:53,700 --> 02:10:55,577
No, not without you.

1633
02:10:55,660 --> 02:10:57,616
I'll be all right. 
Listen, I'll be fine.

1634
02:10:57,700 --> 02:10:59,737
I'm a survivor, all right?
Don't worry about me.

1635
02:10:59,821 --> 02:11:01,015
Now, go on. Get on.

1636
02:11:01,101 --> 02:11:03,740
I have an arrangement with an officer
on the other side of the ship.

1637
02:11:03,821 --> 02:11:06,210
Jack and I can get off safely. 
Both of us.

1638
02:11:07,661 --> 02:11:09,857
See? I got my own boat to catch.

1639
02:11:09,942 --> 02:11:12,502
- Go.
- Come on, hurry. They're almost full.

1640
02:11:13,782 --> 02:11:14,817
Step aboard, miss.

1641
02:11:14,902 --> 02:11:16,255
- Go.
- Come on, hurry.

1642
02:11:17,062 --> 02:11:19,098
- Step aboard, please.
- You're Daddy's good girl.

1643
02:11:19,182 --> 02:11:21,333
- Step lively!
- Keep back.

1644
02:11:21,463 --> 02:11:23,101
Keep back, I say.

1645
02:11:24,863 --> 02:11:26,581
Clear the rail, please.

1646
02:11:27,583 --> 02:11:28,857
Lower away!

1647
02:11:32,424 --> 02:11:33,652
Steady.

1648
02:11:36,464 --> 02:11:38,534
And lower away evenly, lads.

1649
02:11:39,264 --> 02:11:40,253
Easy.

1650
02:11:40,704 --> 02:11:41,933
Lower away.

1651
02:11:42,025 --> 02:11:43,743
You're a good liar.

1652
02:11:43,905 --> 02:11:45,133
Almost as good as you.

1653
02:11:45,225 --> 02:11:47,898
Easy, now. And lower away.

1654
02:11:50,185 --> 02:11:53,258
There's no ... 
There's no arrangement, is there?

1655
02:11:54,906 --> 02:11:56,419
No, there is.

1656
02:11:56,626 --> 02:11:58,776
Not that you'll benefit much from it.

1657
02:11:58,866 --> 02:12:00,060
And even away.

1658
02:12:00,466 --> 02:12:01,455
I always win, Jack.

1659
02:12:01,546 --> 02:12:03,344
And lower away evenly, lads.

1660
02:12:03,427 --> 02:12:04,496
One way or another.

1661
02:12:04,587 --> 02:12:07,260
Watch that trim. Trim that boat.

1662
02:12:08,347 --> 02:12:09,336
Easy.

1663
02:12:10,307 --> 02:12:11,581
Even, lads.

1664
02:12:12,187 --> 02:12:14,816
Keep going!

1665
02:13:00,512 --> 02:13:01,581
Rose!

1666
02:13:03,752 --> 02:13:05,151
- Stop her!
- Rose!

1667
02:13:05,472 --> 02:13:07,384
- What are you doing?
- Stop her!

1668
02:13:08,353 --> 02:13:09,388
No!

1669
02:13:26,954 --> 02:13:28,069
Rose!

1670
02:13:31,355 --> 02:13:34,028
You're so stupid! 
Why did you do that?

1671
02:13:34,435 --> 02:13:36,107
You're so stupid, Rose.

1672
02:13:37,835 --> 02:13:39,747
Why did you do that? Why?

1673
02:13:40,316 --> 02:13:42,193
You jump, I jump, right?

1674
02:13:44,276 --> 02:13:45,311
Right.

1675
02:13:47,356 --> 02:13:48,505
Oh, God.

1676
02:13:48,596 --> 02:13:50,986
I couldn't go. I couldn't go, Jack.

1677
02:13:51,557 --> 02:13:53,912
It's all right. 
We'll think of something.

1678
02:13:54,797 --> 02:13:56,833
At least I'm with you.

1679
02:14:09,918 --> 02:14:11,237
Come on! Move!

1680
02:14:12,239 --> 02:14:13,467
Come on!

1681
02:14:14,319 --> 02:14:15,911
Come on! Move!

1682
02:14:21,999 --> 02:14:23,149
Come on!

1683
02:14:30,680 --> 02:14:31,715
Move!

1684
02:14:37,641 --> 02:14:39,040
Come on, come on, Rose!

1685
02:14:41,361 --> 02:14:42,760
Rose, come on!

1686
02:14:45,442 --> 02:14:46,511
Move, Rose!

1687
02:14:49,522 --> 02:14:50,557
Go!

1688
02:15:00,483 --> 02:15:02,633
I hope you enjoy your time together!

1689
02:15:16,605 --> 02:15:18,402
What could possibly be funny?

1690
02:15:19,285 --> 02:15:21,435
I put the diamond in the coat.

1691
02:15:24,325 --> 02:15:26,316
And I put the coat on her!

1692
02:15:27,846 --> 02:15:29,040
Come on.

1693
02:15:47,367 --> 02:15:49,040
Dada!

1694
02:15:52,088 --> 02:15:53,487
We can't leave him.

1695
02:15:57,488 --> 02:15:58,921
All right, come on!

1696
02:16:00,609 --> 02:16:02,440
Dada!

1697
02:16:14,810 --> 02:16:15,879
Go back!

1698
02:16:26,411 --> 02:16:28,606
That's the wrong way! Come back!

1699
02:16:35,092 --> 02:16:36,081
Go!

1700
02:16:38,412 --> 02:16:39,447
Go!

1701
02:16:40,332 --> 02:16:41,685
Run, Rose!

1702
02:16:48,813 --> 02:16:49,802
Jack!

1703
02:16:53,013 --> 02:16:54,447
- Jack!
- Rose!

1704
02:17:06,735 --> 02:17:07,804
This way!

1705
02:17:16,816 --> 02:17:17,805
Come on!

1706
02:17:19,136 --> 02:17:20,455
Give me your hand!

1707
02:17:28,897 --> 02:17:30,216
Oh, God!

1708
02:17:34,537 --> 02:17:35,572
Help!

1709
02:17:41,098 --> 02:17:42,213
Help!

1710
02:17:44,138 --> 02:17:46,447
Wait, sir! Sir, 
open the gate, please!

1711
02:17:46,538 --> 02:17:48,928
- Please!
- Please, help us!

1712
02:17:49,179 --> 02:17:50,692
- Please!
- Please!

1713
02:17:51,899 --> 02:17:53,048
Bloody hell!

1714
02:17:56,299 --> 02:17:57,288
Hurry.

1715
02:17:58,700 --> 02:18:00,452
- Come on, come on!
- Come on!

1716
02:18:00,980 --> 02:18:02,129
Go, go!

1717
02:18:02,220 --> 02:18:03,289
Jesus.

1718
02:18:04,100 --> 02:18:05,419
- Please!
- Come on!

1719
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:06,729
Hurry!

1720
02:18:07,100 --> 02:18:08,135
Come on!

1721
02:18:13,261 --> 02:18:14,933
I'm sorry, I dropped the keys.

1722
02:18:15,661 --> 02:18:16,935
- Wait, please!
- Wait!

1723
02:18:18,221 --> 02:18:21,055
Don't leave! Please, send for help!

1724
02:18:38,743 --> 02:18:40,814
I got it! Which one is it, Rose?

1725
02:18:41,104 --> 02:18:42,981
The short one. Try the short one.

1726
02:18:43,944 --> 02:18:45,218
Hurry, Jack.

1727
02:18:48,304 --> 02:18:50,295
Oh, no! No, it won't go in.

1728
02:18:50,544 --> 02:18:51,773
Hurry, Jack.

1729
02:18:54,305 --> 02:18:56,296
It's stuck! It's stuck!

1730
02:18:57,105 --> 02:18:59,016
- Come on!
- Hurry, Jack!

1731
02:19:00,305 --> 02:19:01,784
Hurry, Jack!

1732
02:19:04,466 --> 02:19:06,741
I got it! Go, Rose!

1733
02:19:07,626 --> 02:19:09,059
Go!

1734
02:19:18,747 --> 02:19:20,021
Jack!

1735
02:19:21,987 --> 02:19:23,386
Come on!

1736
02:19:24,708 --> 02:19:25,982
Move, move.

1737
02:19:35,669 --> 02:19:38,706
- Get those oars in place.
- Get an oar under it.

1738
02:19:39,429 --> 02:19:41,624
Women and children only, damn you!

1739
02:19:42,429 --> 02:19:44,989
Hold it!

1740
02:19:55,230 --> 02:19:59,144
Get these davits cranked in!
Let's get the falls hooked up!

1741
02:20:07,952 --> 02:20:09,180
Stay back!

1742
02:20:10,992 --> 02:20:12,311
Mommy!

1743
02:20:12,912 --> 02:20:14,504
Stay back, sir!

1744
02:20:15,912 --> 02:20:17,551
Stay back, I say.

1745
02:20:18,993 --> 02:20:20,426
Keep going up!

1746
02:20:23,193 --> 02:20:24,751
Stop pushing!

1747
02:20:25,713 --> 02:20:27,704
Stay back!

1748
02:20:27,793 --> 02:20:30,467
Will you give us a chance to live,
you limey bastard?

1749
02:20:30,554 --> 02:20:33,273
I'll shoot any man who tries 
to get past me! Get back!

1750
02:20:33,354 --> 02:20:34,423
Bastard!

1751
02:20:34,514 --> 02:20:35,788
Get back!

1752
02:20:36,434 --> 02:20:38,345
We had a deal, damn it!

1753
02:20:40,675 --> 02:20:44,554
Your money can't save you anymore
than it can save me. Get back!

1754
02:20:45,755 --> 02:20:47,473
Women and children only!

1755
02:20:49,876 --> 02:20:51,150
Stop pushing!

1756
02:20:53,276 --> 02:20:54,550
No, Tommy!

1757
02:20:55,076 --> 02:20:56,828
No! No, Tommy!

1758
02:20:57,516 --> 02:20:58,744
Bastardo!

1759
02:21:15,678 --> 02:21:16,906
No, Will!

1760
02:21:23,399 --> 02:21:24,388
Now stand back, damn you!

1761
02:21:28,199 --> 02:21:30,508
Gently, hold it.

1762
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:42,152
I have a child!

1763
02:21:43,240 --> 02:21:44,833
Clear a path!

1764
02:21:44,921 --> 02:21:46,832
Please, I have a child.

1765
02:21:47,561 --> 02:21:50,029
Please, I'm all she has in the world.

1766
02:21:50,841 --> 02:21:51,876
Go on.

1767
02:21:52,241 --> 02:21:53,674
Step back!

1768
02:21:53,761 --> 02:21:54,751
Please!

1769
02:21:54,842 --> 02:21:56,798
Here. Give her to me.

1770
02:22:02,562 --> 02:22:04,280
There, there.

1771
02:22:08,083 --> 02:22:10,472
Wait! Mr. Andrews.

1772
02:22:12,963 --> 02:22:14,191
Oh, Rose.

1773
02:22:16,724 --> 02:22:18,954
Won't you even make a try for it?

1774
02:22:20,164 --> 02:22:23,918
I'm sorry that I didn't build you
a stronger ship, young Rose.

1775
02:22:26,524 --> 02:22:28,516
It's going fast. We have to move.

1776
02:22:28,605 --> 02:22:29,640
Wait.

1777
02:22:32,645 --> 02:22:34,476
Good luck to you, Rose.

1778
02:22:35,925 --> 02:22:37,199
And to you.

1779
02:22:49,087 --> 02:22:51,806
Mr. Guggenheim? These are for you.

1780
02:22:51,887 --> 02:22:54,401
No, thank you.
We are dressed in our best ...

1781
02:22:54,487 --> 02:22:57,081
and are prepared to go down
as gentlemen.

1782
02:22:57,847 --> 02:22:59,486
But we would like a brandy.

1783
02:23:00,208 --> 02:23:02,085
Get the falls over here now!

1784
02:23:02,808 --> 02:23:05,242
Make them taut. Then we'll right it!

1785
02:23:11,609 --> 02:23:14,601
Capitain, Capitain, 
where should I go? Please.

1786
02:23:20,410 --> 02:23:22,970
Captain. Sir.

1787
02:23:52,773 --> 02:23:54,650
Right. That's it, then.

1788
02:23:55,653 --> 02:23:57,689
Goodbye, Wally, good luck.

1789
02:23:58,013 --> 02:24:00,527
- Goodbye, Wallace.
- So long, old chap.

1790
02:25:11,460 --> 02:25:15,089
And so they lived happily 
together for 300 years ...

1791
02:25:16,180 --> 02:25:18,614
in the land of "Tir na nÓg" ...

1792
02:25:18,901 --> 02:25:21,210
land of eternal youth and beauty.

1793
02:25:55,664 --> 02:25:58,417
There's no time! Cut the falls!

1794
02:25:58,504 --> 02:26:00,859
Cut them if you have to!

1795
02:26:01,464 --> 02:26:03,695
I need a knife!

1796
02:26:05,225 --> 02:26:08,615
Cut the falls now! Cut them loose!

1797
02:26:19,426 --> 02:26:21,223
Cut those bloody falls!

1798
02:27:06,751 --> 02:27:10,426
Gentlemen, it has been a privilege
playing with you tonight.

1799
02:28:08,956 --> 02:28:10,993
We have to stay on the ship
as long as possible.

1800
02:28:11,077 --> 02:28:12,271
Come on.

1801
02:28:23,718 --> 02:28:25,629
This way. Hold the rail.

1802
02:28:27,438 --> 02:28:29,633
Come on, Rose. Jump.

1803
02:28:32,078 --> 02:28:33,228
Come on.

1804
02:29:05,322 --> 02:29:06,960
I got you. Jump!

1805
02:29:09,402 --> 02:29:11,120
I've got you, miss.

1806
02:29:11,562 --> 02:29:12,961
- Jack!
- What?

1807
02:29:14,762 --> 02:29:15,798
Back!

1808
02:29:44,725 --> 02:29:46,397
No, you'll swamp us!

1809
02:29:54,406 --> 02:29:55,680
Nobody panic.

1810
02:29:58,887 --> 02:30:01,959
Yea, though I walk through the 
valley of the shadow of death —

1811
02:30:02,047 --> 02:30:04,720
You want to walk a little faster
through that valley, there?

1812
02:30:52,692 --> 02:30:55,160
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us, sinners ...

1813
02:30:55,252 --> 02:30:57,561
now and at the hour 
of our death. Amen.

1814
02:30:57,652 --> 02:30:59,085
Hail Mary, full of grace ...

1815
02:30:59,172 --> 02:31:00,366
This way.

1816
02:31:10,973 --> 02:31:12,372
Come on!

1817
02:31:21,334 --> 02:31:23,564
And I saw a new heaven 
and a new Earth.

1818
02:31:23,654 --> 02:31:26,965
For the first heaven and the 
first Earth had passed away ...

1819
02:31:28,255 --> 02:31:30,246
and there was no more sea.

1820
02:31:35,856 --> 02:31:38,893
It'll be over soon. 
It'll all be over soon.

1821
02:31:44,576 --> 02:31:46,169
And he shall dwell with them ...

1822
02:31:46,257 --> 02:31:47,975
and they shall be his people ...

1823
02:31:48,057 --> 02:31:51,493
and God himself shall be with them
and be their God.

1824
02:31:52,617 --> 02:31:53,811
Jack ...

1825
02:31:54,617 --> 02:31:56,096
this is where we first met.

1826
02:32:03,178 --> 02:32:06,488
And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes ...

1827
02:32:06,578 --> 02:32:08,854
and there shall be no more death ...

1828
02:32:09,419 --> 02:32:11,933
neither shall there 
be sorrow or crying ...

1829
02:32:12,019 --> 02:32:14,487
neither shall there 
be any more pain ...

1830
02:32:14,859 --> 02:32:17,327
for the former world has passed away.

1831
02:32:31,621 --> 02:32:33,816
Bloody pull faster! And pull!

1832
02:32:56,223 --> 02:32:57,656
Hang on, Miss Trudy!

1833
02:33:31,906 --> 02:33:33,544
Hold on real tight.

1834
02:33:50,428 --> 02:33:51,827
God almighty!

1835
02:33:59,029 --> 02:34:01,384
Keep those breakers in! Keep them in!

1836
02:35:17,396 --> 02:35:18,954
We have to move!

1837
02:35:24,157 --> 02:35:26,034
Give me your hand, I'll pull you over.

1838
02:35:26,357 --> 02:35:28,348
Come on, give me your hand.

1839
02:35:30,597 --> 02:35:32,714
I've got you. I won't let go.

1840
02:35:32,798 --> 02:35:33,787
Come on, I've got you.

1841
02:35:44,879 --> 02:35:47,393
- What's happening, Jack?
- I don't know.

1842
02:35:56,560 --> 02:35:58,118
- Hold on!
- Jack!

1843
02:36:01,120 --> 02:36:03,270
Somebody help me, please!

1844
02:36:38,324 --> 02:36:39,643
This is it!

1845
02:36:51,245 --> 02:36:53,475
Oh, my God, Jack!

1846
02:36:54,605 --> 02:36:55,799
Hold on!

1847
02:37:10,327 --> 02:37:12,557
The ship is gonna suck us down.

1848
02:37:12,847 --> 02:37:14,439
Take a deep breath when I say.

1849
02:37:19,888 --> 02:37:22,243
Kick for the surface and keep kicking.

1850
02:37:22,328 --> 02:37:23,807
Do not let go of my hand.

1851
02:37:30,809 --> 02:37:33,277
We're going to make it, Rose. Trust me.

1852
02:37:33,369 --> 02:37:34,688
I trust you.

1853
02:37:39,168 --> 02:37:42,400
Ready? Now!

1854
02:38:17,692 --> 02:38:19,444
Jack!

1855
02:38:23,212 --> 02:38:24,566
- Rose!
- Jack!

1856
02:38:29,013 --> 02:38:30,002
Jack!

1857
02:38:49,855 --> 02:38:51,447
Jack!

1858
02:39:02,056 --> 02:39:03,569
Get off her!

1859
02:39:07,136 --> 02:39:08,286
- Rose!
- Jack!

1860
02:39:08,377 --> 02:39:10,607
Swim, Rose! I need you to swim!

1861
02:39:14,337 --> 02:39:15,770
Keep swimming.

1862
02:39:19,498 --> 02:39:21,728
- It's so cold.
- Swim, Rose!

1863
02:39:26,978 --> 02:39:28,697
Come on. Here.

1864
02:39:30,059 --> 02:39:32,209
Keep swimming. Come on.

1865
02:39:34,499 --> 02:39:36,091
Here, get on it.

1866
02:39:37,379 --> 02:39:38,812
Get on top.

1867
02:39:45,980 --> 02:39:47,413
Come on, Rose.

1868
02:39:56,421 --> 02:39:58,332
Stay on it. Stay on, Rose.

1869
02:40:18,983 --> 02:40:20,814
It'll be all right now.

1870
02:40:22,864 --> 02:40:24,582
You'll be all right now.

1871
02:40:31,544 --> 02:40:34,423
Return the boats!

1872
02:40:38,265 --> 02:40:40,654
The boats are coming 
back for us, Rose.

1873
02:40:40,945 --> 02:40:43,061
Hold on just a little bit longer.

1874
02:40:43,145 --> 02:40:45,706
They had to row away 
for the suction ...

1875
02:40:46,946 --> 02:40:49,141
but now they'll be coming back.

1876
02:40:50,746 --> 02:40:52,065
For God's sake!

1877
02:40:52,146 --> 02:40:55,139
Please help us!

1878
02:41:00,267 --> 02:41:01,985
You don't understand.

1879
02:41:02,667 --> 02:41:06,786
If we go back, they'll swamp the boat.
They'll pull us right down, I'm telling you.

1880
02:41:06,868 --> 02:41:09,223
Knock it off. You're scaring me.

1881
02:41:09,548 --> 02:41:12,142
Come on, girls, grab an oar. Let's go.

1882
02:41:12,228 --> 02:41:15,504
Are you out of your mind? We're in 
the middle of the North Atlantic.

1883
02:41:15,588 --> 02:41:18,865
Now, do you people want to live
or do you want to die?

1884
02:41:25,309 --> 02:41:27,540
I don't understand a one of you.

1885
02:41:29,230 --> 02:41:32,427
What's the matter with you?
It's your men out there!

1886
02:41:35,110 --> 02:41:36,748
There's plenty of room for more.

1887
02:41:36,830 --> 02:41:38,662
And there'll be one less on this boat.

1888
02:41:38,751 --> 02:41:41,470
If you don't shut 
that hole in your face!

1889
02:41:56,952 --> 02:41:58,908
Bring in your oars over there.

1890
02:41:58,992 --> 02:42:01,507
Tie these two boats together as well.

1891
02:42:05,193 --> 02:42:07,912
Now, make sure that's tied up
nice and tight.

1892
02:42:11,114 --> 02:42:13,503
Right, listen to me, men.
We have to go back.

1893
02:42:13,594 --> 02:42:17,109
I want to transfer all the women
from this boat into that boat right now.

1894
02:42:17,194 --> 02:42:18,513
As quick as you can, please.

1895
02:42:18,594 --> 02:42:21,063
Let's create some space over there.
Move forward and out.

1896
02:42:30,435 --> 02:42:32,108
It's getting quiet.

1897
02:42:34,396 --> 02:42:39,106
It's just going to take a couple of 
minutes to get the boats organized.

1898
02:42:42,597 --> 02:42:44,428
I don't know about you ...

1899
02:42:44,517 --> 02:42:48,271
but I intend to write
a strongly-worded letter ...

1900
02:42:48,357 --> 02:42:50,825
to the White Star Line about all this.

1901
02:42:57,718 --> 02:42:59,310
I love you, Jack.

1902
02:43:05,719 --> 02:43:07,311
Don't you do that.

1903
02:43:08,599 --> 02:43:10,715
Don't you say your goodbyes.

1904
02:43:11,159 --> 02:43:13,275
Not yet. Do you understand me?

1905
02:43:13,879 --> 02:43:15,233
I'm so cold.

1906
02:43:16,120 --> 02:43:17,553
Listen, Rose ...

1907
02:43:18,640 --> 02:43:20,517
you're gonna get out of here.

1908
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:22,998
You're gonna go on ...

1909
02:43:23,480 --> 02:43:26,075
and you're gonna make lots of babies.

1910
02:43:26,521 --> 02:43:28,637
And you're gonna watch them grow.

1911
02:43:29,881 --> 02:43:33,840
You're gonna die an old lady,
warm in her bed.

1912
02:43:36,041 --> 02:43:37,236
Not here.

1913
02:43:37,802 --> 02:43:39,281
Not this night.

1914
02:43:39,682 --> 02:43:42,116
Not like this. 
Do you understand me?

1915
02:43:44,962 --> 02:43:46,680
I can't feel my body.

1916
02:43:48,803 --> 02:43:52,591
Winning that ticket was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1917
02:43:54,403 --> 02:43:56,121
It brought me to you.

1918
02:43:57,764 --> 02:43:59,994
And I'm thankful for that, Rose.

1919
02:44:00,684 --> 02:44:02,083
I'm thankful.

1920
02:44:04,124 --> 02:44:06,513
You must ...

1921
02:44:07,644 --> 02:44:09,203
do me this honor.

1922
02:44:12,245 --> 02:44:15,043
You must promise me that you'll survive.

1923
02:44:16,485 --> 02:44:18,794
That you won't give up ...

1924
02:44:20,086 --> 02:44:21,963
no matter what happens.

1925
02:44:24,406 --> 02:44:26,362
No matter how hopeless.

1926
02:44:29,967 --> 02:44:31,685
Promise me now, Rose.

1927
02:44:34,127 --> 02:44:36,436
And never let go of that promise.

1928
02:44:37,767 --> 02:44:39,041
I promise.

1929
02:44:41,288 --> 02:44:42,721
Never let go.

1930
02:44:45,528 --> 02:44:47,439
I'll never let go, Jack.

1931
02:44:50,248 --> 02:44:51,841
I'll never let go.

1932
02:45:15,011 --> 02:45:16,603
Right ahead, sir.

1933
02:45:19,571 --> 02:45:20,606
Oars!

1934
02:45:21,331 --> 02:45:23,128
Do you see any moving?

1935
02:45:24,012 --> 02:45:25,923
No, sir. None moving, sir.

1936
02:45:26,452 --> 02:45:27,771
Check them.

1937
02:45:28,092 --> 02:45:29,923
Bring that oar up here.

1938
02:45:35,733 --> 02:45:37,564
Check them. Make sure.

1939
02:45:37,933 --> 02:45:39,685
These are dead, sir.

1940
02:45:40,173 --> 02:45:42,448
Now give way. Ahead easy.

1941
02:45:49,174 --> 02:45:51,847
Careful with your oars. 
Don't hit them.

1942
02:45:54,654 --> 02:45:56,885
Is there anyone alive out there?

1943
02:45:58,415 --> 02:46:00,326
Can anyone hear me?

1944
02:46:02,215 --> 02:46:04,445
Is there anyone alive out there?

1945
02:46:11,176 --> 02:46:12,655
We waited too long.

1946
02:46:16,496 --> 02:46:18,852
Keep checking them! Keep looking!

1947
02:46:20,217 --> 02:46:22,447
Is there anyone alive out there?

1948
02:46:25,937 --> 02:46:27,609
Can anyone hear me?

Jack?

1955
02:47:49,185 --> 02:47:50,664
There's a boat.

1956
02:47:51,185 --> 02:47:52,220
Jack?

1957
02:48:16,508 --> 02:48:18,226
There's a boat, Jack.

1958
02:49:00,192 --> 02:49:01,466
Come back.

1959
02:49:10,873 --> 02:49:12,147
Come back!

1960
02:49:16,793 --> 02:49:18,431
Hello!

1961
02:49:19,873 --> 02:49:21,705
Can anyone hear me?

1962
02:49:22,634 --> 02:49:24,590
There's nothing here, sir.

1963
02:49:26,394 --> 02:49:27,668
Come back.

1964
02:49:37,875 --> 02:49:40,628
I'll never let go. I promise.

1965
02:50:22,559 --> 02:50:23,878
Come about!

1966
02:50:44,521 --> 02:50:47,719
1,500 people went into the sea ...

1967
02:50:48,242 --> 02:50:51,075
when Titanic sank from under us.

1968
02:50:53,122 --> 02:50:55,875
There were 20 boats floating nearby ...

1969
02:50:57,202 --> 02:50:59,080
and only one came back.

1970
02:51:01,283 --> 02:51:02,272
One.

1971
02:51:04,003 --> 02:51:06,437
6 were saved from the water ...

1972
02:51:06,803 --> 02:51:08,362
myself included.

1973
02:51:09,764 --> 02:51:14,042
6 out of 1,500.

1974
02:51:17,204 --> 02:51:21,357
Afterward, 
the 700 people in the boats ...

1975
02:51:21,725 --> 02:51:24,034
had nothing to do but wait.

1976
02:51:25,805 --> 02:51:28,797
Wait to die, wait to live.

1977
02:51:30,286 --> 02:51:32,356
Wait for an absolution ...

1978
02:51:32,846 --> 02:51:34,757
that would never come.

1979
02:52:36,372 --> 02:52:38,647
Sir, I don't think you'll find
any of your people down here.

1980
02:52:38,732 --> 02:52:40,324
It's all steerage.

1981
02:52:45,213 --> 02:52:48,046
His hair is reddish brown,
and a white beard.

1982
02:52:48,173 --> 02:52:50,971
- Isn't there another passenger list?
- There's no other list.

1983
02:52:51,053 --> 02:52:54,363
- Perhaps he's on another ship.
- We're doing all we can.

1984
02:53:17,096 --> 02:53:19,610
That's the last time I ever saw him.

1985
02:53:19,816 --> 02:53:22,888
He married, of course,
and inherited his millions.

1986
02:53:24,056 --> 02:53:27,173
But the crash of '29 
hit his interests hard.

1987
02:53:27,576 --> 02:53:30,137
And he put a pistol 
in his mouth that year.

1988
02:53:30,457 --> 02:53:31,856
Or so I read.

1989
02:53:44,458 --> 02:53:46,574
Can I take your name, please, love?

1990
02:53:48,858 --> 02:53:49,974
Dawson.

1991
02:53:52,219 --> 02:53:53,572
Rose Dawson.

1992
02:53:54,659 --> 02:53:55,933
Thank you.

1993
02:54:02,620 --> 02:54:06,454
We never found anything on Jack.
There's no record of him at all.

1994
02:54:07,420 --> 02:54:09,297
No, there wouldn't be, would there?

1995
02:54:09,940 --> 02:54:14,457
And I've never spoken of him 
until now. Not to anyone.

1996
02:54:15,261 --> 02:54:17,331
Not even your grandfather.

1997
02:54:17,621 --> 02:54:20,897
A woman's heart
is a deep ocean of secrets.

1998
02:54:22,222 --> 02:54:25,498
But now you know there was a 
man named Jack Dawson ...

1999
02:54:25,982 --> 02:54:27,779
and that he saved me ...

2000
02:54:28,262 --> 02:54:31,015
in every way 
that a person can be saved.

2001
02:54:33,263 --> 02:54:35,652
I don't even have a picture of him.

2002
02:54:38,223 --> 02:54:41,932
He exists now only in my memory.

2003
02:54:46,784 --> 02:54:49,503
Keldysh, Mir-2 on our way 
to the surface.

2004
02:55:05,986 --> 02:55:08,898
I was saving this
for when I found the diamond.

2005
02:55:17,667 --> 02:55:18,941
I'm sorry.

2006
02:55:21,627 --> 02:55:22,946
3 years.

2007
02:55:23,587 --> 02:55:26,227
I've thought of nothing 
except Titanic.

2008
02:55:26,828 --> 02:55:28,546
But I never got it.

2009
02:55:31,523 --> 02:55:33,115
I never let it in.
