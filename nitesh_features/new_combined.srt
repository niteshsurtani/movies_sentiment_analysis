Actually, I did.

So now do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Phoebe knows,
and she's just trying to freak us out.

That's the only explanation for it.

Okay, but what about my pinchable butt
and my bulging biceps?

But, hey, it's over now, right?

175
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,751
Because you can tell them
you know they know...

176
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,337
...and I can go back to knowing
absolutely nothing.

I wouldn't bring that up.
It would probably just bum him out.

00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:13,870
She said that in front of our kid.

312
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:17,823
Imagine going to school
with that in your head.

313
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:23,826
Difference between men and women?

314
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,373
I would never say something
that cruel to her.

315
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:31,320
Certainly not in front of Carl.

316
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,395
All available units, high speed
pursuit in progress

317
00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:42,508
Lincoln county units
request local assistance.

318
00:08:42,628 --> 00:08:47,058
Highway 18 south GTAAD W217 243.

319
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:48,574
Proceed with extreme caution.

320
00:09:01,188 --> 00:09:03,277
Suspects are two male Caucasians.

321
00:09:03,398 --> 00:09:05,370
Be advised, they have fired
on police officers.

322
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:07,472
One Lindon county officer is wounded.

323
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:19,809
Unit 1, Unit 3, please ***.

324
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:24,361
18, 2 miles west of lnterstate 85
and we'll patch in Lindon County Sheriff radio.

325
00:09:25,252 --> 00:09:28,726
Roger that. We're 5 minutes out
on the route 18 intersection.

326
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:33,207
Dispatch, Unit 1, Unit 3, we are 10-97
in code 100.

327
00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:35,887
Highway 18, *** Interstate, please advise.

328
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,491
***

329
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:55,924
Sounds like they're chasing those idiots
up and down every back road we got.

330
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:57,945
Hey, we'll get them on one of
those video shows, you know,

331
00:09:57,984 --> 00:10:00,012
like World's craziest police chases,
what do you think?

332
00:10:00,065 --> 00:10:02,120
What I think, Leon, is that
you need to stay focused.

333
00:10:02,412 --> 00:10:04,869
Make sure you got a round
in the chamber and your safety off.

334
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:14,509
Would be kind of cool to get on
one of them shows.

335
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,049
Holy shit.

336
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:28,112
- Gun, gun, gun.
- Put it down!

337
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:30,015
Put the gun down!

338
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:05,885
- Rick!
- I'm alright!

339
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:13,049
I saw you get tagged, man,
it scared the hell out of me.

340
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,040
Me too.

341
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:18,612
Son of a bitch shot me.
You believe that?

342
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:20,144
We'll get you a new vest.

343
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,412
Yeah.

344
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:27,363
Shane, you do not tell Lori
that happened. Ever.

345
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:29,014
You understand... Aah!

346
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:33,931
Rick! Rick!
No, no, no!

347
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,105
Shh, shh, shh.

348
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:38,498
No, no, no, no...

349
00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:39,654
He's hurt!

350
00:12:40,157 --> 00:12:41,283
***

351
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:44,982
You get that ambulance down here, you tell
them there's an officer down, you do it now!

352
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:49,706
Shh, shh, shh, hey, you look at me,
stay with me, you hear me? Shh, shh. okay.

353
00:12:49,972 --> 00:12:53,681
Shh, shh, stay with me, you hear me?

354
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:54,743
Shh, shh, ok?

355
00:12:54,863 --> 00:12:56,573
You stay with me, ok?

356
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:15,049
Hey, bud...

357
00:13:16,892 --> 00:13:18,380
We're still here.

358
00:13:19,309 --> 00:13:20,836
We're still hanging in.

359
00:13:25,257 --> 00:13:26,549
Look, I'm sorry, man.

360
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:29,157
I'm mean watching the same crap
every time I come in here.

361
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:35,900
Everybody pitched in on these. They uh...

362
00:13:36,664 --> 00:13:38,914
They wanted me to bring them down,
they send their love and they just...

363
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,373
They hope you come back real soon.

364
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:48,342
Linda and Diane from dispatch,
they picked these out.

365
00:13:49,573 --> 00:13:50,649
You probably could tell, hmm?

366
00:13:53,585 --> 00:13:55,703
I'll just set this on your side table, ok?

367
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:08,502
That vase has something special.

368
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:12,250
Fess up. Did you steal it from
your Grandma Gene's house.

369
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,713
I hope you left her that spoon collection.

370
00:14:24,326 --> 00:14:25,329
Shane?

371
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:31,480
Shane, you in the john?

372
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,850
Nurse, help.

373
00:15:52,924 --> 00:15:53,993
Nurse.

374
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:55,524
Help!

375
00:23:44,368 --> 00:23:45,706
Lori!

376
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:49,849
Lori!

377
00:23:57,034 --> 00:23:58,386
Carl!

378
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:00,243
Carl!

379
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:09,101
Lori! Carl!

380
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:26,368
Lori! Carl!

381
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:46,484
Is this real?
Am I here?

382
00:24:53,437 --> 00:24:55,057
Wake, wake up!

383
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,012
- Daddy, daddy!
- Carl...

384
00:26:12,262 --> 00:26:13,211
Carl?

385
00:26:13,774 --> 00:26:14,704
I found you...

386
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,072
Daddy, I got this sumbitch.
I'm gonna smack him dead.

387
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,278
He say something?
I thought I heard him say something.

388
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,971
- He called me Carl.
- Son, you know they don't talk.

389
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:30,999
Hey, mister!

390
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,166
What's that bandage for?

391
00:26:35,313 --> 00:26:37,172
- What?
- What kind of wound?

392
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:40,282
You answer me, damn you!

393
00:26:41,247 --> 00:26:42,371
What's your wound?

394
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:45,197
You tell me!

395
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,433
Or I will kill you.

396
00:27:11,992 --> 00:27:15,398
Got that bandage changed out.
It was pretty rank.

397
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:19,026
What was? The wound?

398
00:27:20,295 --> 00:27:22,414
- Gun shot.
- Gun shot?

399
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,333
What else? Anything?

400
00:27:26,607 --> 00:27:28,003
Gun shot ain't enough?

401
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:32,316
Look, I ask and you answer,

402
00:27:32,796 --> 00:27:34,483
It's common courtesy, right?

403
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:40,777
Did you get bit?

404
00:27:43,091 --> 00:27:44,798
- Bit?
- Bit. Chewed.

405
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,426
Maybe scratch? Anything like that.

406
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:49,930
No, I got shot.

407
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:53,072
- Just shot?
- As far as I know.

408
00:27:56,747 --> 00:27:57,612
Hey...

409
00:27:58,018 --> 00:27:58,877
Just let me...

410
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:03,919
Feels cooler now.

411
00:28:04,804 --> 00:28:06,501
Fever would have killed you by now.

412
00:28:07,628 --> 00:28:10,250
- I don't think I have one.
- Be hard to miss.

413
00:28:16,785 --> 00:28:17,829
Take a moment, eh?

414
00:28:18,158 --> 00:28:19,396
Look how sharp it is.

415
00:28:20,435 --> 00:28:22,274
You try anything...

416
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:25,779
I will kill you with it,
and don't you think I won't.

417
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:38,993
Come on up when you're able.

418
00:28:43,011 --> 00:28:43,707
Come on.

419
00:29:15,723 --> 00:29:16,890
This place...

420
00:29:18,594 --> 00:29:20,026
It's Fred and Cindy Drake's.

421
00:29:20,944 --> 00:29:22,162
Never met them.

422
00:29:22,872 --> 00:29:25,139
I've been here. This is their place

423
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:27,506
It was empty when we got here.

424
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:31,957
Don't do that.

425
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:33,845
They'll see the light.

426
00:29:34,664 --> 00:29:36,209
There's more of them out there than usual.

427
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,924
I never should have fired that gun today.

428
00:29:40,773 --> 00:29:43,305
The sound draws them,
now they're all over the street.

429
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:47,165
Stupid... using a gun...

430
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:50,114
It all happened so fast...

431
00:29:51,052 --> 00:29:53,863
- I didn't think.
- You shot that man today.

432
00:29:54,762 --> 00:29:55,532
Man?

433
00:29:55,952 --> 00:29:58,657
- No man... - What the hell was that
out of your mouth just now?

434
00:29:59,726 --> 00:30:01,610
- It wasn't a man.
- You shot him.

435
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,560
In this street, out front, a man.

436
00:30:03,598 --> 00:30:05,879
For him, you need glasses,
that was a walker.

437
00:30:06,904 --> 00:30:07,564
Come on.

438
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:11,315
Sit down, before you fall down.

439
00:30:13,026 --> 00:30:14,623
Here. Eat.

440
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,119
Daddy...

441
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:20,285
Blessing...

442
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,331
Yeah.

443
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:38,717
Father, we thank thee for this food...

444
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,125
Thy blessings...

445
00:30:41,115 --> 00:30:44,119
We ask you to watch over us in these crazy days.

446
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,260
- Amen.
- Amen.

447
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:54,361
Hey, mister, do you even know
what is going on?

448
00:30:54,814 --> 00:30:56,302
I woke up today.

449
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,888
In a hospital.

450
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:02,487
Came home, that's all I know.

451
00:31:06,557 --> 00:31:09,336
- But you know about the dead people, right?
- Yeah, I saw a lot of that.

452
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,996
Out on the loading dock, hauling trucks.

453
00:31:13,116 --> 00:31:14,035
No...

454
00:31:14,515 --> 00:31:15,775
Not the one's they put down...

455
00:31:16,054 --> 00:31:18,017
The one's they didn't. The walkers.

456
00:31:19,405 --> 00:31:20,924
Like the one I shot today.

457
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:22,942
Cause he would have ripped into you.

458
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:25,787
Try to eat you, take him
some flesh at least.

459
00:31:27,229 --> 00:31:29,419
But I guess if this is the first
you're hearing,

460
00:31:30,045 --> 00:31:31,653
I know how it must sound...

461
00:31:35,114 --> 00:31:37,363
- They're out there now, in the street?
- Yeah.

462
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:40,723
They're even more active
after dark sometimes.

463
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:42,851
Maybe it's the cool air or...

464
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:45,304
Hell, maybe it's just me
firing up that gun today.

465
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:48,605
But we'll be fine long as we stay quiet.

466
00:31:49,193 --> 00:31:51,002
Probably wander off by morning.

467
00:31:53,566 --> 00:31:54,594
Well, listen...

468
00:31:56,298 --> 00:31:57,730
One thing I do know...

469
00:31:58,777 --> 00:31:59,946
Don't you get bit!

470
00:32:00,646 --> 00:32:03,234
We saw your bandage
and that's why we were afraid of.

471
00:32:04,553 --> 00:32:05,978
Bites kill you.

472
00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:07,998
The fever... burns you out.

473
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,642
But then after a while...

474
00:32:11,962 --> 00:32:12,847
You come back.

475
00:32:19,116 --> 00:32:20,316
Seen it happen...

476
00:32:26,036 --> 00:32:27,146
Come on...

477
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:36,492
Carl...

478
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,958
He your son?

479
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:40,816
William..

480
00:32:42,014 --> 00:32:43,326
He said his name today...

481
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,374
He's a little younger...

482
00:32:46,877 --> 00:32:47,865
than your boy.

483
00:32:48,543 --> 00:32:49,651
And he's with his mother?

484
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:53,087
I hope so.

485
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,160
- Dad?
- Yeah?

486
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,107
Did you ask him?

487
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,659
Your gun shot...

488
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:07,186
We got a little bet going.
My boy say you're a...

489
00:33:07,716 --> 00:33:09,321
bank robber...

490
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:11,969
Yeah...

491
00:33:12,754 --> 00:33:16,490
That's me. Deadly as Dillinger.
Kapow.

492
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:18,838
Sheriff's deputy.

493
00:33:20,648 --> 00:33:21,433
Aha.

494
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:27,141
Hey, it's ok, daddy's here.

495
00:33:27,436 --> 00:33:28,513
It's nothing.

496
00:33:29,363 --> 00:33:32,047
One of them must've bumped a car...

497
00:33:32,441 --> 00:33:35,544
- You sure?
- Happened once before.

498
00:33:36,689 --> 00:33:38,423
Went off a few minutes.

499
00:33:40,547 --> 00:33:42,024
Get the light, Dwayne.

500
00:33:56,276 --> 00:33:58,201
It's the blue one, down the street.

501
00:33:58,889 --> 00:34:00,496
Same one as last time.

502
00:34:01,135 --> 00:34:02,613
I think we're ok.

503
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,006
That noise...

504
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,814
Will it bring more of them?

505
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:10,976
Nothing to do about it now.

506
00:34:12,371 --> 00:34:13,966
Just have to wait 'em out till morning.

507
00:34:19,006 --> 00:34:20,006
She's here.

508
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:23,207
Don't look.
Get away from the windows.

509
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,776
I said go! Come on!

510
00:34:34,868 --> 00:34:36,717
Come on, quiet.

511
00:34:37,288 --> 00:34:39,820
Shh, shh...

512
00:34:58,923 --> 00:35:02,114
It's ok, here. Cry into the pillow.

513
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:03,449
Can you remember?

514
00:35:03,846 --> 00:35:05,403
Shh...

515
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:44,800
She, uh...

516
00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:50,445
She died in the other room, on that bed...

517
00:35:52,898 --> 00:35:55,882
Nothin' I can do about it here...

518
00:35:56,463 --> 00:35:57,841
That fever, man...

519
00:35:59,406 --> 00:36:01,647
Her skin gave off heat like a furnace...

520
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:12,570
Should have put her down, I should
have put her down, I know that, but...

521
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:15,852
You know what...

522
00:36:16,129 --> 00:36:17,686
I just didn't have it in me...

523
00:36:22,136 --> 00:36:24,402
She's the mother of my child.

524
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:52,539
- You sure?
- They're dead.

525
00:36:53,236 --> 00:36:55,658
They have to ask, at least one more time.

526
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,727
They're dead.
Except for something in the brain.

527
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:01,890
That's why it's gotta be the head.

528
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:28,015
You alright?

529
00:37:30,023 --> 00:37:31,151
Need a moment?

530
00:37:37,103 --> 00:37:38,270
They're alive.

531
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:39,947
My wife and son.

532
00:37:40,418 --> 00:37:41,944
At least they were when they left.

533
00:37:42,065 --> 00:37:43,433
How can you know?

534
00:37:44,402 --> 00:37:47,663
- By the look of this place...
- I found empty drawers in the bedroom.

535
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:49,942
They packed some clothes. Not a lot.

536
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:51,420
But enough to travel.

537
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:54,901
You know anybody could've broken in here
and stolen clothes, right?

538
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,631
You see the framed photos on the walls?

539
00:37:59,299 --> 00:38:02,461
Neither do I. Some random thief
took those too, you think?

540
00:38:06,678 --> 00:38:09,582
My photo albums, family pictures, all gone.

541
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:12,510
Photo albums...

542
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,619
My wife...

543
00:38:20,747 --> 00:38:21,855
Same thing...

544
00:38:23,114 --> 00:38:27,149
Here I am, packing survival gear,
she's grabbing photo albums....

545
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,597
They're in Atlanta, I'll bet.

546
00:38:34,577 --> 00:38:35,754
That's right.

547
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,557
- Why there?
- Refugee settle.

548
00:38:39,594 --> 00:38:41,951
Huge, when they said it,
before the broadcast stopped.

549
00:38:42,824 --> 00:38:45,455
Military protection, food, shelter...

550
00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:47,556
They told people to go there.

551
00:38:48,134 --> 00:38:49,314
Said to be safest.

552
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,437
Plus they got that disease place.

553
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:53,282
Center for Disease Control.

554
00:38:53,612 --> 00:38:56,424
Said they were working on
how to solve this thing.

555
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,521
Gas and light have been down
for maybe a month.

556
00:39:26,979 --> 00:39:29,017
Station got its own propane system.

557
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,239
Pilot's still on.

558
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:38,217
Oh, my Lord.

559
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:40,104
Hot water!

560
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:42,384
- Whoo!
- That feels good, right?

561
00:39:53,338 --> 00:39:54,217
Dwayne...

562
00:39:55,707 --> 00:39:57,124
Dress in room back there.

563
00:39:58,222 --> 00:39:59,455
What you say, Dwayne?

564
00:40:00,418 --> 00:40:01,356
Thank you.

565
00:40:02,675 --> 00:40:03,793
Mhm.

566
00:40:07,267 --> 00:40:08,835
Atlanta sounds like a good deal.

567
00:40:09,926 --> 00:40:11,598
Safer anyway. People...

568
00:40:13,168 --> 00:40:14,357
That's where we were heading.

569
00:40:15,453 --> 00:40:18,137
Things got crazy. Man, you won't believe.

570
00:40:18,257 --> 00:40:19,151
The panic...

571
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:21,816
Streets won't fit to be on,
and then we'll...

572
00:40:23,993 --> 00:40:25,041
My wife...

573
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,742
couldn't travel. no, not with our herd,

574
00:40:27,862 --> 00:40:29,502
so we had to find a place to lay low.

575
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:31,837
And then, after she died...

576
00:40:35,022 --> 00:40:36,505
We just stayed hunkered down.

577
00:40:39,442 --> 00:40:41,266
I guess we just froze in place.

578
00:40:43,201 --> 00:40:44,442
Plan to move on?

579
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,109
Haven't worked up to it yet. (*)

580
00:40:58,711 --> 00:41:00,230
A lot of it's gone missing.

581
00:41:01,647 --> 00:41:03,158
Dad, can I learn to shoot?

582
00:41:03,279 --> 00:41:04,743
I'm old enough.

583
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:06,212
Hell yes you're going to learn.

584
00:41:06,332 --> 00:41:08,689
We gotta do it carefully, teach you
to respect the weapon.

585
00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:10,613
That's right. It's not a toy.

586
00:41:10,962 --> 00:41:14,195
You pull the trigger, you have to mean it.
Always remember that, Dwayne.

587
00:41:14,315 --> 00:41:15,247
Yes, sir.

588
00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:18,678
Here.

589
00:41:20,362 --> 00:41:21,325
Go on.

590
00:41:26,682 --> 00:41:28,032
Take that one.

591
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,357
Nothing fancy.

592
00:41:29,831 --> 00:41:31,272
Scope's accurate.

593
00:41:44,143 --> 00:41:49,159
Conserve your ammo. Goes faster than
you think. Especially at target practice.

594
00:41:50,692 --> 00:41:51,571
Dwayne.

595
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:53,636
- Yeah?
- Take this to the car.

596
00:41:55,226 --> 00:41:56,684
You sure you won't come along?

597
00:41:57,655 --> 00:41:58,870
A few more days...

598
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,238
By the end, Dwayne will know how
to shoot and I won't be so rusty.

599
00:42:09,816 --> 00:42:11,044
You got one better.

600
00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:14,375
I'll turn mine on, a few minutes
every day at dawn.

601
00:42:14,494 --> 00:42:16,946
You get up there, that's how you find me.

602
00:42:17,607 --> 00:42:19,929
- You think they're here?
- Can't afford not to.

603
00:42:20,242 --> 00:42:22,953
- Not anymore.
- Look, just one thing.

604
00:42:23,384 --> 00:42:25,349
They may not seem
like much one at a time...

605
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,764
but in a group all round up and hungry...

606
00:42:28,385 --> 00:42:30,793
- They you watch your ass.
- You too.

607
00:42:33,336 --> 00:42:34,397
You a good man, Rick.

608
00:42:35,007 --> 00:42:36,515
I hope you find your wife and son.

609
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,598
Be seeing you, Dwayne.

610
00:42:41,587 --> 00:42:43,604
- Take care of your old man.
- Yes, sir.

611
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:56,536
Leon Bessi?

612
00:43:00,652 --> 00:43:02,016
Didn't think much of him.

613
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,056
Careless and dumb, but...

614
00:43:04,956 --> 00:43:07,098
can't leave him like this.

615
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:12,231
You know, if they hear the shot..?

616
00:43:12,662 --> 00:43:15,514
- Let's not be here when they show up.
- Let's go, son.

617
00:43:15,986 --> 00:43:16,865
Come on.

618
00:44:50,136 --> 00:44:51,872
Read your comic books a while.

619
00:44:52,327 --> 00:44:53,721
Daddy'll be upstairs.

620
00:46:55,777 --> 00:46:57,961
- Daddy?
- It's alright, Dwayne.

621
00:46:58,507 --> 00:47:00,768
You stay there, son.
Don't come up here.

622
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:31,514
Come on, baby.

623
00:48:02,383 --> 00:48:05,178
I'm sorry this happened to you.

624
00:48:59,462 --> 00:49:01,173
Come on, come on.

625
00:49:55,698 --> 00:49:57,522
Broadcasting on emergency channel.

626
00:49:57,642 --> 00:50:00,231
We'll be approaching Atlanta on Highway 85.

627
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,439
Anybody reads, please respond.

628
00:50:05,466 --> 00:50:07,499
Hello. Hello.

629
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,257
Can anybody hear my voice?

630
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:15,536
Anybody out there?
Anybody hears me, please respond.

631
00:50:17,805 --> 00:50:19,464
Hello, can you hear my voice?

632
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:22,658
Hello? Hello? Can anybody hear my voice?

633
00:50:24,366 --> 00:50:25,265
Hey? Hello?

634
00:50:25,759 --> 00:50:27,405
- Can you hear my voice?
- Yes, I can hear you.

635
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:28,761
You're coming through. Over.

636
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,600
Anybody who reads, please respond.

00:50:34,105 --> 00:50:37,194
We'll be approaching Atlanta
on Highway 85.

639
00:50:37,314 --> 00:50:39,351
Anybody reads, please respond.

640
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:44,202
We're just outside the city.

641
00:50:45,114 --> 00:50:46,033
Damnit.

642
00:50:46,702 --> 00:50:47,661
Hello?

643
00:50:48,251 --> 00:50:49,177
Hello?

644
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:51,251
He couldn't hear me. I couldn't warn him.

645
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:52,292
Try to raise him again.

646
00:50:52,627 --> 00:50:54,704
Come on, son. You know best
how to work this thing,

647
00:50:57,685 --> 00:51:00,169
Hello, hello, is the person
who calls still on the air?

648
00:51:03,467 --> 00:51:07,295
This is officer Shane Walsh, broadcasting
a person unknown, please respond.

649
00:51:13,921 --> 00:51:14,963
He's gone.

650
00:51:17,258 --> 00:51:19,362
There are others. It's not just us.

651
00:51:19,667 --> 00:51:22,022
Yeah, We knew there would be, right,
that's why we let the CB on.

652
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:24,276
Lot of good it's been doing.

653
00:51:24,984 --> 00:51:27,478
And I've been saying for a week,
we ought to put signs up on 85

654
00:51:27,524 --> 00:51:28,970
to warn people away from the city.

655
00:51:29,392 --> 00:51:31,368
Folks got no idea
what they're getting into.

656
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:33,318
We don't have enough time.

657
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:36,382
I think we need to make time.

658
00:51:36,777 --> 00:51:38,305
Yeah, that, uh...

659
00:51:38,923 --> 00:51:40,408
That's a luxury we can't afford.

660
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:43,244
We are surviving here.
We are day to day.

661
00:51:44,445 --> 00:51:46,256
And who the hell would you propose to send?

662
00:51:46,376 --> 00:51:48,193
I'll go. Give me a vehicle.

663
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:50,284
Nobody goes anywhere alone, you know that.

664
00:51:55,476 --> 00:51:56,886
Yes, sir.

665
00:51:57,424 --> 00:52:00,817
Hey, hey, hey, come on, take a sit, buddy.
You're alright, go on, you're alright.

666
00:52:05,303 --> 00:52:06,401
What, you're pissed at me?

667
00:52:09,317 --> 00:52:11,494
Well pissing me all you want
won't gonna change anything.

668
00:52:13,821 --> 00:52:16,868
I'm not putting you in danger, okay?
I'm not doing it for anything.

669
00:52:17,332 --> 00:52:20,784
I make you feel like sometimes you wanna
slap me outside the head...

670
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:23,507
I'll tell you what, girl. You feel that need,
you go right ahead. I'm right here.

671
00:52:26,984 --> 00:52:29,314
You cannot walk off like that,

672
00:52:29,555 --> 00:52:31,379
all half-cocked.

673
00:52:31,835 --> 00:52:34,632
Look, if you don't wanna do it for
my sake or for your sake, that's fine.

674
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:35,569
But just...

675
00:52:36,512 --> 00:52:37,575
You do it for him.

676
00:52:39,095 --> 00:52:40,754
That boy has been through too much.

677
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,636
And he's not losing his mother too, ok?

678
00:52:44,835 --> 00:52:45,694
Okay.

679
00:52:47,151 --> 00:52:48,107
Ok, fine.

680
00:52:51,988 --> 00:52:53,102
You tell me okay.

681
00:53:00,501 --> 00:53:01,589
It's not hard.

682
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:06,443
Hey...

683
00:53:20,995 --> 00:53:22,400
Mom?

684
00:53:26,212 --> 00:53:28,011
What's up, buddy? She's in there, go on.

685
00:53:29,899 --> 00:53:30,898
Hey.

686
00:53:31,507 --> 00:53:34,002
I don't want you to worry.
Your mom is not going anywhere.

687
00:53:34,123 --> 00:53:35,066
Okay?

688
00:53:35,852 --> 00:53:39,259
- Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Go finish your chores.
- Okay.

689
00:54:23,377 --> 00:54:24,346
Hello?

690
00:54:26,533 --> 00:54:28,204
Police officer out here.

691
00:54:30,951 --> 00:54:32,256
Can I borrow some gas?

692
00:54:41,491 --> 00:54:42,528
Hello?

693
00:54:48,449 --> 00:54:49,399
Hello?

694
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:51,656
Anybody home?

695
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:39,850
Easy now, easy.

696
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:41,461
I'm not gonna hurt you.

697
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,608
Nothing like that.

698
00:56:46,144 --> 00:56:47,571
More like a proposal.

699
00:56:49,579 --> 00:56:51,027
Atlanta's just down the road ways.

700
00:56:51,147 --> 00:56:52,207
It's safe there.

701
00:56:52,641 --> 00:56:56,971
Food, shelter, people,
other horses too, I bet.

702
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:00,113
How's that sound?

703
00:57:01,557 --> 00:57:03,292
There we go. Good boy.

704
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:09,384
Good boy. Now come with me.
Come with me.

705
00:57:21,042 --> 00:57:24,846
Let's go easy, ok?
I haven't done this for years.

706
00:57:30,085 --> 00:57:35,626
Easy. Easy, boy. Easy, easy, easy.

707
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:55,316
Let's go.

708
00:59:47,941 --> 00:59:51,207
Steady. It's just a few.
Nothing we can't outrun.

709
01:00:01,482 --> 01:00:03,159
Okay, whoa whoa whoa.

710
01:02:42,138 --> 01:02:44,798
Lori, Carl, I'm sorry.

711
01:05:09,008 --> 01:05:10,269
Hey, you.

712
01:05:12,567 --> 01:05:13,555
Dumb ass.

713
01:05:16,155 --> 01:05:17,329
Hey, you in the tank.

714
01:05:18,213 --> 01:05:19,247
Cozy in there?

715
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:53,019
13 meters. You should see it.

716
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,051
Okay, take her up and over the bow rail.

717
00:02:09,498 --> 00:02:12,699
Okay, Mir-2, we're going over the bow.
Stay with us.

718
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:47,572
Okay, quiet. We're rolling.

719
00:02:48,216 --> 00:02:51,577
Seeing her coming out of the darkness
like a ghost ship ...

720
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:53,572
still gets me every time.

721
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:57,929
To see the sad ruin of the great ship,
sitting here ...

722
00:02:58,744 --> 00:03:03,098
where she landed at 2:30 in the morning
of April 15, 1912 ...

723
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:05,378
after her long fall ...

724
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,939
from the world above.

725
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,657
You're so full of shit, boss.

726
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,569
Dive 6.

727
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,492
Here we are again on the deck of Titanic.

728
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:45,490
2½ miles down.

729
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,169
3,821 meters.

730
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:53,048
The pressure outside
is 3½ tons per square inch.

731
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,858
These windows are 9 inches thick
and if they go ...

732
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:58,248
it's sayonara in 2 microseconds.

733
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:01,368
All right, enough of that bullshit.

734
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:17,889
Just put her down on the roof
of the officers' quarters like yesterday.

735
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:18,967
Sure.

736
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:22,136
Okay, Mir-2, we're landing
right over the Grand Staircase.

737
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:24,015
You guys set to launch?

738
00:04:24,218 --> 00:04:27,051
Yeah, Brock, launching Dunkin now.
Go, Charlie.

739
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:36,934
- All right, tether out.
- Tether out.

740
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:40,256
Okay, Brock,
we're dropping down along the hull.

741
00:04:42,818 --> 00:04:46,969
Yeah, roger that. Okay, drop down,
and go into the first-class gangway door.

742
00:04:47,057 --> 00:04:51,255
I want you guys working the "D" deck
reception area and the dining saloon.

743
00:04:51,897 --> 00:04:53,171
Copy that.

744
00:04:58,777 --> 00:04:59,892
- Tether out.
- Tether out.

745
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:02,013
Okay, now left. Now left. Left, left.

746
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:13,933
Snoop Dog is on the move.
We're headed down the stairwell.

747
00:05:16,977 --> 00:05:18,968
Okay, Lewis, drop down to "B" deck.

748
00:05:19,096 --> 00:05:20,245
"A" deck.

749
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:23,010
- Give me some rope, Captain.
- "B" deck. Get in there.

750
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:03,692
- Watch the door frame. Watch it.
- I see it. I got it.

751
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:11,409
We're good. Just chill, boss.

752
00:06:24,654 --> 00:06:26,372
Okay, make your turn.

753
00:06:27,214 --> 00:06:29,603
- Cable out, Captain.
- Make your turn. Watch the wall.

754
00:06:29,694 --> 00:06:32,083
Brock, we're at the piano. You copy?

755
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:33,722
Copy that.

756
00:06:41,454 --> 00:06:42,728
Right there.

757
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:45,772
- That's it. That's the bedroom door.
- I see it.

758
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:58,045
We're in. We're in, baby. We're there.

759
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:03,849
That's Hockley's bed.
That's where the son of a bitch slept.

760
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:11,768
Oops. Somebody left the water running.

761
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:14,651
Hold it. Just a second.
Go back to the right.

762
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,968
That wardrobe door. Get closer.

763
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,730
- You're smelling something, boss.
- I want to see what's under it.

764
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:28,609
Give me my hands, man.

765
00:07:33,612 --> 00:07:34,840
All right.

766
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:38,845
- Take it easy. It might come apart.
- Okay.

767
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:43,402
Okay, go. Flip it over. Go. Turn over.

768
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:45,125
Keep going. Go.

769
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:47,451
Okay, drop it.

770
00:07:56,051 --> 00:07:58,565
Oh, baby. Are you seeing this, boss?

771
00:08:02,011 --> 00:08:03,603
It's payday, boys.

772
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,205
Cha-ching!

773
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:23,959
- We did it, Bobby.
- We brought it back.

774
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:25,405
Oh, yeah! You the man!

775
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:28,562
Who's the best, baby? Say it.

776
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,369
You are, Lewis.

777
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,966
- Bobby, my cigar.
- Right here.

778
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,129
Okay, crack her open.

779
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,685
Let me get around. Hang on.

780
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,044
- You getting it?
- Got it.

781
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:13,398
Shit.

782
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:16,723
No diamond.

783
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:20,199
You know, boss,
this same thing happened to Geraldo ...

784
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:21,847
and his career never recovered.

785
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:27,962
Turn the camera off.

786
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:31,166
Brock. The partners would like to know
how it's going.

787
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:35,039
Hey, Dave. Barry, hi.
Look, it wasn't in the safe.

788
00:09:35,128 --> 00:09:38,518
Don't worry about it. There are
still plenty of places it could be.

789
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:39,597
Hell, yes.

790
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:42,043
The floor debris in the suite,
the mother's room ...

791
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:44,483
- The purser's safe on "C" deck.
- Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.

792
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:45,762
A dozen other places.

793
00:09:45,848 --> 00:09:49,079
Guys, look, you just got to trust
my instincts. I know we're close.

794
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:52,399
We just got to go through
a little process of elimination.

795
00:09:53,088 --> 00:09:54,646
Hang on a second.

796
00:09:57,688 --> 00:10:00,964
- Let me see that.
- We might have something here, guys.

797
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:06,204
- Where's the photograph of the necklace?
- We'll call you right back.

798
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,080
I'll be goddamned.

799
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:24,764
Treasure hunter Brock Lovett
is best known for finding Spanish gold.

800
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:27,315
It's okay, I'll feed you in a minute.

801
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:31,036
He has chartered Russian subs to reach
the most famous shipwreck of all ...

802
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:32,446
the Titanic.

803
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:36,042
He's with us live via satellite,
from the research ship Keldysh ...

804
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:37,401
in the North Atlantic.

805
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:39,523
- Hello, Brock.
- Hello, Tracy.

806
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,525
Of course, everyone knows
the familiar stories of Titanic.

807
00:10:42,606 --> 00:10:45,996
You know, the nobility of the band
playing to the very end and all that.

808
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:48,441
But what I'm interested in
are the untold stories ...

809
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:51,040
the secrets locked deep inside
the hull of Titanic.

810
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:54,323
And we're out here using robot technology
to go further into the wreck ...

811
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:56,158
than anybody has ever done before.

812
00:10:56,246 --> 00:10:58,396
Your expedition is at the center
of a storm ...

813
00:10:58,486 --> 00:11:01,364
of controversy over salvage rights,
and even ethics.

814
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:03,198
Many are calling you a grave-robber.

815
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:06,403
Nobody ever called the recovery
of the artifacts from King Tut's tomb ...

816
00:11:06,486 --> 00:11:08,556
- What is it?
- Turn that up, dear.

817
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:11,319
I have museum-trained experts
sent out here making sure ...

818
00:11:11,406 --> 00:11:14,238
that these relics are preserved
and catalogued properly.

819
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:17,158
Take a look at this drawing
that we found just today.

820
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:20,442
A piece of paper that's been underwater
for 84 years ...

821
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:23,403
and my team are able to preserve it intact.

822
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,959
Should this have remained unseen
at the bottom of the ocean for eternity?

823
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,478
We can see it and ...

824
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,157
I'll be goddamned.

825
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:37,323
Brock, there's a satellite call for you.

826
00:11:37,724 --> 00:11:40,956
Bobby, we're launching. See these
submersibles going in the water?

827
00:11:41,044 --> 00:11:43,798
Trust me, buddy,
you want to take this call.

828
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,522
This better be good.

829
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:50,235
- You got to speak up. She's kind of old.
- Great.

830
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:54,953
This is Brock Lovett.
How can I help you, Mrs. ...

831
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:56,796
Calvert. Rose Calvert.

832
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:58,517
Mrs. Calvert?

833
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:04,114
I was just wondering if you had found
the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett.

834
00:12:06,484 --> 00:12:08,839
Told you you wanted to take the call.

835
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:12,797
All right, you have my attention, Rose.

836
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:16,075
Can you tell us who the woman
in the picture is?

837
00:12:16,163 --> 00:12:18,757
Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.

838
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,638
She's a goddamn liar!
Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.

839
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:42,958
God only knows why!
Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.

840
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:44,635
They're inbound!

841
00:12:49,722 --> 00:12:53,431
Rose Dewitt Bukater died on the Titanic
when she was 17, right?

842
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,637
That's right.

843
00:12:54,722 --> 00:12:57,236
If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.

844
00:12:57,322 --> 00:12:59,438
101 next month.

845
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:02,315
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.

846
00:13:02,602 --> 00:13:04,957
Look, I've already done the background
on this woman ...

847
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:08,751
all the way back to the '20s,
when she was working as an actress.

848
00:13:08,842 --> 00:13:11,720
An actress.
There's your first clue, Sherlock.

849
00:13:11,962 --> 00:13:16,239
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.
Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

850
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:19,758
They move to Cedar Rapids
and she punches out a couple of kids.

851
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,799
Now Calvert's dead, and from what I hear,
Cedar Rapids is dead.

852
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:24,519
And everybody
who knows about the diamond ...

853
00:13:24,601 --> 00:13:27,479
is supposed to be dead or on this boat,
but she knows.

854
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:42,835
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?

855
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:44,639
Hurry up, give him a hand!

856
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:48,277
Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.
Welcome to the Keldysh.

857
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:51,792
Okay, let's get her inside there.

858
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,632
- Hi, Miss Calvert.
- Hi.

859
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,518
- Welcome to the Keldysh.
- Thanks.

860
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,349
Yes?

861
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,637
- Are your staterooms all right?
- Oh, yes, very nice.

862
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,635
Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy?
She takes care of me.

863
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,757
We met just a few minutes ago.
Remember, Nana, up on deck?

864
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,915
Oh, yeah ...

865
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,152
There. That's nice.
Have to have my pictures when I travel.

866
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,996
Can I get you anything?
Is there anything you'd like?

867
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:31,354
Yes.

868
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,034
I would like to see my drawing.

869
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,757
Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone
called the Blue Diamond of the Crown.

870
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,228
It disappeared in 1792.

871
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,792
About the same time old Louis
lost everything from the neck up.

872
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:02,468
The theory goes that the 
crown diamond was chopped, too.

873
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:06,950
Re-cut into a heart-like shape that 
became known as the "Heart of the Ocean".

874
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:10,030
Today, it would be worth
more than the Hope Diamond.

875
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:14,316
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.
I only wore it this once.

876
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:16,946
You actually think this is you, Nana?

877
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:18,557
It is me, dear.

878
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,876
Wasn't I a dish?

879
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:25,396
I tracked it down
through insurance records.

880
00:15:25,477 --> 00:15:29,152
An old claim that was settled
under terms of absolute secrecy.

881
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:32,876
Can you tell me
who the claimant was, Rose?

882
00:15:33,157 --> 00:15:35,751
I should imagine someone named Hockley.

883
00:15:36,077 --> 00:15:39,308
Nathan Hockley. That's right.
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

884
00:15:40,117 --> 00:15:44,668
The claim was for a diamond necklace
his son, Caledon, bought his fiancée, you.

885
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:47,906
A week before he sailed on Titanic.

886
00:15:48,757 --> 00:15:51,271
It was filed right after the sinking.

887
00:15:51,797 --> 00:15:54,947
So the diamond had to have gone down
with the ship.

888
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:57,596
You see the date?

889
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:00,594
April 14, 1912.

890
00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:03,475
Which means if your grandmother
is who she says she is ...

891
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:06,753
she was wearing the diamond
the day the Titanic sank.

892
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:09,396
And that makes you my new best friend.

893
00:16:10,516 --> 00:16:13,826
These are some of the things
we recovered from your stateroom.

894
00:16:16,036 --> 00:16:17,435
This was mine.

895
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,474
How extraordinary!

896
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:24,872
And it looks the same as it did
the last time I saw it.

897
00:16:30,316 --> 00:16:32,545
The reflection has changed a bit.

898
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:51,104
Are you ready to go back to Titanic?

899
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,824
Here we go.
She hits the 'berg on the starboard side.

900
00:16:58,355 --> 00:17:02,950
She kind of bumps along, punching holes
like Morse code along the side ...

901
00:17:03,034 --> 00:17:04,547
below the water line.

902
00:17:04,634 --> 00:17:06,704
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.

903
00:17:06,794 --> 00:17:10,628
Now, as the water level rises,
it spills over the watertight bulkheads ...

904
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:13,751
which, unfortunately,
don't go any higher than "E" deck.

905
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:17,986
So now, as the bow goes down,
the stern rises up, slow at first ...

906
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:22,465
then faster and faster, until finally,
she's got her whole ass sticking in the air.

907
00:17:22,554 --> 00:17:25,944
And that's a big ass.
We're talking 20,000, 30,000 tons.

908
00:17:26,314 --> 00:17:28,874
Okay? And the hull's not designed to deal
with that pressure.

909
00:17:28,954 --> 00:17:32,469
So what happens?
She splits, right down to the keel ...

910
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:35,069
and the stern falls back level.

911
00:17:35,714 --> 00:17:40,389
Then as the bow sinks, it pulls the stern
vertical and then finally detaches.

912
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:45,665
Now the stern section kind of bobs there
like a cork for a couple of minutes ...

913
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:48,347
floods, and finally goes under
about 2:20 am ...

914
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:51,231
2 hours and 40 minutes
after the collision.

915
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:55,952
The bow section planes away,
landing about a ½ a mile away ...

916
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,945
going 20, 30 knots
when it hits the ocean floor.

917
00:18:02,392 --> 00:18:03,745
Pretty cool, huh?

918
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:07,620
Thank you for that fine 
forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.

919
00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:11,421
Of course, 
the experience of it was —

920
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:14,503
somewhat different.

921
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:17,143
Will you share it with us?

922
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,661
- I'm taking her to rest.
- No.

923
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,667
- Come on, Nana.
- No!

924
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,501
Give me the tape recorder.

925
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,183
Tell us, Rose.

926
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,828
It's been 84 years.

927
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,740
It's okay. Just try to remember 
anything, anything at all.

928
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,388
Do you want to hear this 
or not, Mr. Lovett?

929
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:42,068
It's been 84 years ...

930
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:46,337
and I can still smell the fresh paint.

931
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:50,625
The china had never been used.

932
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:54,138
The sheets had never been slept in.

933
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:59,665
Titanic was called "The Ship of Dreams".

934
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:02,423
And it was.

935
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:04,902
It really was.

936
00:20:33,628 --> 00:20:37,780
All third-class passengers
with a forward berth ...

937
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:40,666
this way, please! 
This queue! Right here ...

938
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:43,740
- It's a big boat, huh?
- Daddy, it's a ship.

939
00:20:43,828 --> 00:20:45,226
You're right.

940
00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:16,101
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

941
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:18,702
It doesn't look any bigger
than the Mauretania.

942
00:21:18,786 --> 00:21:22,017
You can be blasé about some things, 
Rose, but not about Titanic.

943
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:26,065
It's over 100 feet longer than 
Mauretania, and far more luxurious.

944
00:21:26,186 --> 00:21:29,337
Your daughter is far too difficult
to impress, Ruth.

945
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:31,701
So this is the ship 
they say is unsinkable.

946
00:21:31,786 --> 00:21:34,300
It is unsinkable.
God himself could not sink this ship.

947
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:37,105
Sir, you have to check your baggage
through the main terminal.

948
00:21:37,186 --> 00:21:38,221
It's round that way, sir.

949
00:21:38,306 --> 00:21:40,661
I put my faith in you, good sir.
Now, kindly see my man.

950
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:43,419
Yes, sir. It's my pleasure, sir.
If I can do anything at all ...

951
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:44,780
Yes, right.

952
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:48,619
All the trunks from that car there.
12 from here.

953
00:21:49,386 --> 00:21:53,901
And the safe, to the parlor suite,
rooms B-52, 54, 56.

954
00:21:55,865 --> 00:21:59,221
Ladies, we better hurry. Come along.

955
00:22:03,785 --> 00:22:05,696
- My coat?
- I have it, miss.

956
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:08,174
Queue here for health inspection.

957
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:11,894
All third-class passengers
queue here for health inspection.

958
00:22:12,545 --> 00:22:13,739
Chin up.

959
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,217
- Welcome aboard, ma'am.
- Welcome to Titanic.

960
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:25,613
It was the ship of dreams
to everyone else.

961
00:22:26,264 --> 00:22:28,380
To me, it was a slave ship ...

962
00:22:28,944 --> 00:22:31,663
taking me back to America in chains.

963
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:36,743
Outwardly, I was everything
a well brought up girl should be.

964
00:22:37,104 --> 00:22:39,174
Inside, I was screaming.

965
00:22:55,344 --> 00:22:58,301
Jack, you are pazzo.
You bet everything we have.

966
00:22:59,303 --> 00:23:02,181
When you got nothing,
you got nothing to lose.

967
00:23:08,903 --> 00:23:10,018
Sven?

968
00:23:10,903 --> 00:23:11,892
Bet.

969
00:23:30,462 --> 00:23:31,451
All right.

970
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:34,739
Moment of truth.
Somebody's life is about to change.

971
00:23:35,862 --> 00:23:36,977
Brizio?

972
00:23:39,062 --> 00:23:40,461
- Niente.
- Niente.

973
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:42,891
Olaf?

974
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:44,971
Nothing.

975
00:23:45,222 --> 00:23:46,257
Sven?

976
00:23:50,582 --> 00:23:51,810
2 pair.

977
00:23:52,382 --> 00:23:53,940
I'm sorry, Fabrizio.

978
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:55,932
Che sorry, ma vaffanculo!
Did you bet all our money?

979
00:23:56,021 --> 00:23:59,900
I'm sorry, you're not going to
see your mom again for a long time.

980
00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:03,219
'Cause we're going to America.
Full house, boys.

981
00:24:16,661 --> 00:24:17,776
Come on.

982
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:20,340
I'm going home!

983
00:24:22,981 --> 00:24:25,541
- I'm going home.
- I go to America!

984
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:27,374
No, mate.

985
00:24:27,621 --> 00:24:31,056
Titanic go to America, in 5 minutes.

986
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:34,328
Shit, Fabri. Come on. Come on, here.

987
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,978
We're riding in high style now.
We're a couple of regular swells.

988
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,052
We're practically goddamn royalty,
ragazzo mio.

989
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,176
You see? Is my destino.

990
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,491
Like I told you,
I go to America to be millionaire.

991
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,417
- You are pazzo.
- Maybe, but I've got the tickets.

992
00:24:56,179 --> 00:24:58,488
- I thought you were fast.
- Aspetta!

993
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:01,293
Wait! Hey, wait!

994
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,371
We're passengers! Passengers!

995
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:07,211
Have you been through
the inspection queue?

996
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:08,334
Of course.

997
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:11,570
Anyway, we don't have any lice.
We're Americans, both of us.

998
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:13,457
Right. Come aboard.

999
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:20,289
We're the luckiest sons of bitches
in the world. You know that?

1000
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:30,293
Goodbye!

1001
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:36,536
- You know somebody?
- Of course not. That's not the point.

1002
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,973
- Goodbye. I'll miss you.
- Goodbye!

1003
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:41,618
- Goodbye.
- I will never forget you!

1004
00:26:27,537 --> 00:26:29,255
Come with me, darling. Let's go.

1005
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,570
G-60.

1006
00:26:36,056 --> 00:26:37,614
Excuse me, ma'am.

1007
00:26:40,936 --> 00:26:42,255
Right here.

1008
00:26:42,456 --> 00:26:45,607
How you doing? Jack. 
Nice to meet you.

1009
00:26:46,096 --> 00:26:48,769
Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.
How you doing?

1010
00:26:49,616 --> 00:26:51,766
Who says you get top bunk?

1011
00:26:57,136 --> 00:26:59,525
This is your private 
promenade deck, sir.

1012
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:02,335
Would you be requiring anything?
Excuse me.

1013
00:27:03,256 --> 00:27:04,689
- This one?
- No.

1014
00:27:04,976 --> 00:27:06,967
It had a lot of faces on it.

1015
00:27:07,975 --> 00:27:09,488
This is the one.

1016
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:12,851
Would you like all of them out, miss?

1017
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:15,608
Yes, we need a little color in this room.

1018
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,127
Put it in there. In the wardrobe.

1019
00:27:21,775 --> 00:27:24,005
God, not those finger-paintings again.

1020
00:27:24,095 --> 00:27:25,892
They certainly were a waste of money.

1021
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:29,251
The difference between Cal's taste
in art and mine is that I have some.

1022
00:27:29,335 --> 00:27:31,007
They're fascinating ...

1023
00:27:31,135 --> 00:27:33,444
like being inside a dream or something.

1024
00:27:33,655 --> 00:27:35,134
There's truth, but no logic.

1025
00:27:35,215 --> 00:27:38,206
- What's the artist's name?
- Something Picasso.

1026
00:27:38,294 --> 00:27:42,287
Something Picasso. He won't amount
to a thing. He won't, trust me.

1027
00:27:42,374 --> 00:27:45,127
- Put the Degas in the bedroom.
- At least they were cheap.

1028
00:27:45,774 --> 00:27:47,685
Put it in the wardrobe.

1029
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:56,486
At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard
named Margaret Brown.

1030
00:27:56,814 --> 00:27:58,691
We all called her Molly.

1031
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:01,931
History would call her
the "Unsinkable Molly Brown".

1032
00:28:02,054 --> 00:28:04,614
I wasn't about to wait 
all day for you, sonny.

1033
00:28:04,694 --> 00:28:06,889
Here, if you think you can manage.

1034
00:28:06,974 --> 00:28:09,965
Her husband had struck gold,
someplace out west.

1035
00:28:10,053 --> 00:28:13,012
And she was what mother called
"New Money. "

1036
00:28:14,253 --> 00:28:17,051
By the next afternoon,
we were steaming west ...

1037
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:19,124
from the coast of Ireland ...

1038
00:28:19,213 --> 00:28:21,966
with nothing out ahead of us but ocean.

1039
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:32,291
Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.
Let's stretch her legs.

1040
00:28:32,653 --> 00:28:33,881
Yes, sir.

1041
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:38,732
- All ahead full, Mr. Moody.
- Very good, sir.

1042
00:28:43,612 --> 00:28:45,092
All ahead full.

1043
00:28:45,492 --> 00:28:47,244
All ahead full!

1044
00:28:47,652 --> 00:28:49,449
Come on, lads, step lively.

1045
00:28:55,852 --> 00:28:57,524
What's the reading?

1046
00:29:06,732 --> 00:29:10,202
All right! Let's stoke her right up!
We go full ahead!

1047
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:12,168
Come on, right back to work.

1048
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,568
21 knots, sir.

1049
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:16,727
Hey, look!

1050
00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:20,483
See it?

1051
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:26,039
There's another one. See him?

1052
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:38,038
Look at that one! Look at him jump!

1053
00:31:02,288 --> 00:31:04,927
I can see the Statue of Liberty already.

1054
00:31:05,288 --> 00:31:07,006
Very small, of course.

1055
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:12,808
I'm the king of the world!

1056
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:01,318
She's the largest moving object ever made
by the hand of man in all history.

1057
00:32:02,526 --> 00:32:06,758
And our master shipbuilder, Mr. Andrews,
here, designed her from the keel plates up.

1058
00:32:06,846 --> 00:32:10,555
I may have knocked her together,
but the idea was Mr. Ismay's.

1059
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,804
He envisioned a steamer
so grand in scale ...

1060
00:32:13,926 --> 00:32:17,839
and so luxurious in its appointments that
its supremacy would never be challenged.

1061
00:32:17,926 --> 00:32:21,521
And here she is, 
willed into solid reality.

1062
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,924
Hear, hear.

1063
00:32:23,806 --> 00:32:25,478
The salmon.

1064
00:32:28,325 --> 00:32:30,555
You know I don't like that, Rose.

1065
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:35,279
She knows.

1066
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:41,474
We'll both have the lamb.
Rare, with very little mint sauce.

1067
00:32:42,685 --> 00:32:44,437
You like lamb, right, sweet pea?

1068
00:32:44,525 --> 00:32:45,514
Sausage.

1069
00:32:46,845 --> 00:32:49,279
You gonna cut her meat for her,
too, there, Cal?

1070
00:32:51,245 --> 00:32:53,884
Hey, who thought of the name Titanic?

1071
00:32:54,725 --> 00:32:57,034
- Was it you, Bruce?
- Yes, actually.

1072
00:32:57,805 --> 00:33:00,159
I wanted to convey sheer size.

1073
00:33:00,364 --> 00:33:02,958
And size means stability, luxury ...

1074
00:33:03,404 --> 00:33:05,235
and above all, strength.

1075
00:33:06,244 --> 00:33:08,553
Do you know of Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?

1076
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:10,999
His ideas about
the male preoccupation with size ...

1077
00:33:11,084 --> 00:33:13,439
might be of particular interest to you.

1078
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:15,881
What's gotten into you?

1079
00:33:15,964 --> 00:33:17,158
Excuse me.

1080
00:33:21,484 --> 00:33:22,917
I do apologize.

1081
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:25,837
She's a pistol, Cal.
Hope you can handle her.

1082
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:28,353
I may have to start minding
what she reads from now on ...

1083
00:33:28,444 --> 00:33:29,797
won't I, Mrs. Brown?

1084
00:33:29,964 --> 00:33:32,352
Freud, who is he? Is he a passenger?

1085
00:33:44,203 --> 00:33:46,239
The ship is nice?

1086
00:33:46,323 --> 00:33:47,881
Yeah, it's an Irish ship.

1087
00:33:47,963 --> 00:33:49,282
Is English, no?

1088
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:52,002
No, it was built in Ireland.
15,000 Irishmen built this ship.

1089
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:54,472
Solid as a rock. Big Irish hands.

1090
00:33:55,123 --> 00:33:56,602
Well, that's typical.

1091
00:33:56,683 --> 00:33:59,436
First-class dogs come down here
to take a shit.

1092
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:02,196
Lets us know where we rank
in the scheme of things.

1093
00:34:02,283 --> 00:34:04,000
Like we could forget.

1094
00:34:05,282 --> 00:34:06,601
I'm Tommy Ryan.

1095
00:34:06,682 --> 00:34:08,081
- Jack Dawson.
- Hello.

1096
00:34:08,162 --> 00:34:09,641
- Fabrizio.
- Hi.

1097
00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:13,076
Do you make any money
with your drawings?

1098
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:23,555
Forget it, boyo.

1099
00:34:24,322 --> 00:34:26,313
You'd as like have angels
fly out of your arse ...

1100
00:34:26,402 --> 00:34:28,631
as get next to the likes of her.

1101
00:34:50,761 --> 00:34:54,151
I saw my whole life
as if I'd already lived it.

1102
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,952
An endless parade of parties
and cotillions ...

1103
00:34:58,441 --> 00:35:00,352
yachts and polo matches.

1104
00:35:00,961 --> 00:35:05,000
Always the same narrow people,
the same mindless chatter.

1105
00:35:06,161 --> 00:35:09,152
I felt like I was standing at
a great precipice ...

1106
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,230
with no one to pull me back.

1107
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,198
No one who cared ...

1108
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,153
or even noticed.

1109
00:37:02,877 --> 00:37:04,196
Don't do it.

1110
00:37:04,677 --> 00:37:05,951
Stay back.

1111
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:08,669
Don't come any closer.

1112
00:37:09,517 --> 00:37:12,030
Come on. Just give me your hand,
I'll pull you back over.

1113
00:37:12,117 --> 00:37:13,947
No! Stay where you are.

1114
00:37:14,476 --> 00:37:15,796
I mean it.

1115
00:37:16,356 --> 00:37:17,675
I'll let go.

1116
00:37:28,476 --> 00:37:29,909
No, you won't.

1117
00:37:31,196 --> 00:37:33,152
What do you mean, no I won't?

1118
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:37,150
Don't presume to tell me what I will
and will not do. You don't know me.

1119
00:37:37,236 --> 00:37:39,704
Well, you would have done it already.

1120
00:37:39,956 --> 00:37:42,150
You're distracting me. Go away.

1121
00:37:42,316 --> 00:37:44,307
I can't. I'm involved now.

1122
00:37:45,756 --> 00:37:48,508
You let go, and I'm gonna have 
to jump in there after you.

1123
00:37:50,555 --> 00:37:52,034
Don't be absurd.

1124
00:37:52,475 --> 00:37:54,943
- You'll be killed.
- I'm a good swimmer.

1125
00:37:55,035 --> 00:37:56,866
The fall alone will kill you.

1126
00:37:56,955 --> 00:37:59,594
It would hurt. 
I'm not saying it wouldn't.

1127
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,186
To tell you the truth,
I'm a lot more concerned ...

1128
00:38:02,275 --> 00:38:04,345
about that water being so cold.

1129
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:12,749
How cold?

1130
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:15,713
Freezing. 
Maybe a couple of degrees over.

1131
00:38:20,594 --> 00:38:23,062
You ever ... 
You ever been to Wisconsin?

1132
00:38:26,674 --> 00:38:27,709
What?

1133
00:38:27,874 --> 00:38:30,547
They have some of the coldest
winters around.

1134
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:32,989
I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls.

1135
00:38:33,154 --> 00:38:36,191
I remember, when I was a kid,
me and my father ...

1136
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,782
we went ice fishing 
out on Lake Wissota.

1137
00:38:39,314 --> 00:38:42,989
- Ice fishing is, you know, where you —
- I know what ice fishing is.

1138
00:38:43,714 --> 00:38:44,863
Sorry.

1139
00:38:46,274 --> 00:38:49,471
You just seem like,
you know, kind of an indoor girl.

1140
00:38:51,394 --> 00:38:52,621
Anyway, I ...

1141
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:55,703
I fell through some thin ice.

1142
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,385
And I'm telling you ...

1143
00:38:58,593 --> 00:39:00,185
water that cold ...

1144
00:39:00,513 --> 00:39:02,344
like right down there ...

1145
00:39:02,913 --> 00:39:06,792
it hits you like a 1,000 knives
stabbing you all over your body.

1146
00:39:07,393 --> 00:39:10,191
You can't breathe. You can't think.

1147
00:39:11,633 --> 00:39:14,227
Least, not about anything but the pain.

1148
00:39:16,913 --> 00:39:20,542
Which is why I'm not looking forward
to jumping in there after you.

1149
00:39:21,273 --> 00:39:22,706
Like I said ...

1150
00:39:23,592 --> 00:39:25,389
I don't have a choice.

1151
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:32,024
I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll 
come back over the rail an ...

1152
00:39:32,112 --> 00:39:33,909
and get me off the hook here.

1153
00:39:34,232 --> 00:39:35,665
You're crazy.

1154
00:39:36,912 --> 00:39:38,903
That's what everybody says bu ...

1155
00:39:40,352 --> 00:39:42,183
but with all due respect, miss ...

1156
00:39:42,272 --> 00:39:45,150
I'm not the one hanging off
the back of a ship here.

1157
00:39:45,672 --> 00:39:46,866
Come on.

1158
00:39:47,592 --> 00:39:49,184
Give me your hand.

1159
00:39:49,632 --> 00:39:51,623
You don't want to do this.

1160
00:40:06,631 --> 00:40:08,189
I'm Jack Dawson.

1161
00:40:09,631 --> 00:40:11,508
Rose Dewitt Bukater.

1162
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:14,424
I'll have to get you 
to write that one down.

1163
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:16,745
Come on.

1164
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,623
I got you. Come on.

1165
00:40:24,431 --> 00:40:25,624
Come on!

1166
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,429
Help, please!

1167
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:37,307
- Please, help me!
- Listen to me. I've got you.

1168
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,069
I won't let go.

1169
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,266
Now pull yourself up. Come on!

1170
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,787
Come on. That's right.

1171
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,863
You can do it.

1172
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,509
I got you.

1173
00:40:58,909 --> 00:41:00,467
What's all this?

1174
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:08,463
You stand back! 
And don't move an inch!

1175
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:12,268
Fetch the master-at-arms.

1176
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:16,499
This is completely unacceptable.

1177
00:41:16,789 --> 00:41:20,304
What made you think you could
put your hands on my fiancée?

1178
00:41:20,669 --> 00:41:22,261
Look at me, you filth!

1179
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:24,385
- Cal.
- What do you think you were doing?

1180
00:41:24,469 --> 00:41:26,584
Cal, stop. It was an accident.

1181
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:29,061
An accident?

1182
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:30,858
It was.

1183
00:41:32,028 --> 00:41:33,427
Stupid, really.

1184
00:41:33,508 --> 00:41:35,783
I was leaning over and I slipped.

1185
00:41:38,308 --> 00:41:40,822
I was leaning far over to see the ...

1186
00:41:45,468 --> 00:41:47,584
- Propellers?
- Propellers, and I slipped.

1187
00:41:47,668 --> 00:41:51,343
And I would have gone overboard,
but Mr. Dawson here saved me.

1188
00:41:51,588 --> 00:41:53,738
And almost went over himself.

1189
00:41:54,228 --> 00:41:56,025
She wanted to see the propellers.

1190
00:41:56,108 --> 00:41:58,906
Like I said,
women and machinery do not mix.

1191
00:41:59,788 --> 00:42:01,619
Was that the way of it?

1192
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,303
Yeah, that was pretty much it.

1193
00:42:06,387 --> 00:42:09,299
Well, the boy's a hero, then.
Good for you, son. Well done.

1194
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:12,425
So, it's all's well and 
back to our brandy, eh?
- Aha.

1195
00:42:13,707 --> 00:42:17,097
Look at you. You must be freezing.
Let's get you inside.

1196
00:42:18,147 --> 00:42:20,741
Err ... perhaps a little 
something for the boy?

1197
00:42:22,547 --> 00:42:23,821
Of course.

1198
00:42:24,267 --> 00:42:25,620
Mr. Lovejoy ...

1199
00:42:25,707 --> 00:42:27,857
I think a 20 should do it.

1200
00:42:28,187 --> 00:42:31,384
Is that the going rate
for saving the woman you love?

1201
00:42:32,147 --> 00:42:33,819
Rose is displeased.

1202
00:42:34,507 --> 00:42:35,825
What to do?

1203
00:42:36,506 --> 00:42:37,621
I know.

1204
00:42:39,706 --> 00:42:42,982
Perhaps you could join us
for dinner tomorrow evening.

1205
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:46,897
To regale our group 
with your heroic tale.

1206
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:51,298
Sure. Count me in.

1207
00:42:51,866 --> 00:42:53,697
Good. It's settled then.

1208
00:42:55,066 --> 00:42:57,102
This should be interesting.

1209
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:07,335
Can I bum a smoke?

1210
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,341
You'll want to tie those.

1211
00:43:20,105 --> 00:43:23,142
It's interesting.
The young lady slipped so suddenly ...

1212
00:43:23,265 --> 00:43:26,735
and you still had time to remove
your jacket and your shoes.

1213
00:43:41,984 --> 00:43:44,134
I know you've been melancholy.

1214
00:43:45,224 --> 00:43:47,215
I don't pretend to know why.

1215
00:43:49,624 --> 00:43:51,535
I intended to save this ...

1216
00:43:51,704 --> 00:43:56,300
until the engagement gala next week.

1217
00:43:57,784 --> 00:44:01,936
But I thought, tonight.

1218
00:44:02,784 --> 00:44:04,183
Good gracious!

1219
00:44:04,664 --> 00:44:07,736
Perhaps as a reminder
of my feelings for you.

1220
00:44:08,144 --> 00:44:10,020
- Is it a —
- Diamond? Yes.

1221
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,972
56 carats to be exact.

1222
00:44:17,463 --> 00:44:19,374
It was worn by Louis XVI.

1223
00:44:20,303 --> 00:44:22,692
And they called it "Le Coeur de la Mer".

1224
00:44:22,783 --> 00:44:26,093
- The "Heart of the Ocean".
- The "Heart of the Ocean". Yes.

1225
00:44:31,063 --> 00:44:32,701
It's overwhelming.

1226
00:44:32,983 --> 00:44:34,780
It's for royalty.

1227
00:44:35,863 --> 00:44:37,614
We are royalty, Rose.

1228
00:44:41,783 --> 00:44:44,660
You know, there is nothing
I couldn't give you.

1229
00:44:44,822 --> 00:44:46,858
There is nothing I'd deny you ...

1230
00:44:47,302 --> 00:44:49,133
if you would not deny me.

1231
00:44:53,462 --> 00:44:55,532
Open your heart to me, Rose.

1232
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:12,972
I've been on my own since I was 15.

1233
00:45:13,061 --> 00:45:14,734
Since my folks died.

1234
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:19,210
And I had no brothers or sisters
or close kin in that part of the country.

1235
00:45:19,581 --> 00:45:22,414
So I lit on out of there
and I haven't been back since.

1236
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:25,732
You can just call me
a tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

1237
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:31,495
Well, Rose, we've walked
about a mile around this boat deck ...

1238
00:45:32,221 --> 00:45:35,418
chewed over how great
the weather's been and how I grew up ...

1239
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:39,216
but I reckon that's not
why you came to talk to me, is it?

1240
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:42,013
- Mr. Dawson, I —
- Jack.

1241
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,329
Jack ...

1242
00:45:44,781 --> 00:45:47,248
I want to thank you for what you did.

1243
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:51,059
Not just for pulling me back ...

1244
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,333
- but for your discretion.
- You're welcome.

1245
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,089
Look ...

1246
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,009
I know what you must be thinking:

1247
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,810
"Poor little rich girl.
What does she know about misery?"

1248
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,489
No.

1249
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,458
That's not what I was thinking.

1250
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,293
What I was thinking was ...

1251
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:13,055
what could have happened to this girl
to make her think she had no way out?

1252
00:46:14,659 --> 00:46:15,979
Well, I ...

1253
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,253
It was everything.

1254
00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:21,490
It was my whole world
and all the people in it.

1255
00:46:21,899 --> 00:46:23,810
And the inertia of my life ...

1256
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:26,977
plunging ahead,
and me, powerless to stop it.

1257
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,536
God, look at that thing.

1258
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:32,253
You'd have gone straight 
to the bottom.

1259
00:46:33,619 --> 00:46:36,213
500 invitations have gone out.

1260
00:46:36,299 --> 00:46:38,972
All of Philadelphia society 
will be there.

1261
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:41,368
And all the while, I feel I'm  ...

1262
00:46:41,459 --> 00:46:43,654
standing in the middle of
a crowded room ...

1263
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:46,697
screaming at the top of my lungs,
and no one even looks up.

1264
00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:49,612
Do you love him?

1265
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:51,652
Pardon me?

1266
00:46:51,738 --> 00:46:53,251
Do you love him?

1267
00:46:53,698 --> 00:46:56,849
You're being very rude.
You shouldn't be asking me this.

1268
00:46:56,938 --> 00:47:00,055
It's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?

1269
00:47:01,658 --> 00:47:03,614
This is not a suitable conversation.

1270
00:47:03,698 --> 00:47:06,258
Why can't you 
just answer the question?

1271
00:47:07,498 --> 00:47:08,977
This is absurd.

1272
00:47:09,138 --> 00:47:10,935
You don't know me 
and I don't know you ...

1273
00:47:11,018 --> 00:47:13,452
and we are not having
this conversation at all.

1274
00:47:13,538 --> 00:47:16,336
You are rude and uncouth
and presumptuous and ...

1275
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:17,771
I am leaving now.

1276
00:47:17,858 --> 00:47:20,417
Jack, Mr. Dawson, 
it's been a pleasure.

1277
00:47:20,498 --> 00:47:22,887
I sought you out to thank you
and now I have thanked you —

1278
00:47:22,977 --> 00:47:24,774
And you've insulted me.

1279
00:47:24,897 --> 00:47:26,455
Well, you deserved it.

1280
00:47:26,537 --> 00:47:27,970
- Right.
- Right.

1281
00:47:30,737 --> 00:47:33,092
- I thought you were leaving.
- I am.

1282
00:47:35,737 --> 00:47:37,455
You are so annoying.

1283
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:40,567
Wait, I don't have to leave.

1284
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:43,251
This is my part of the ship. 
You leave.

1285
00:47:44,017 --> 00:47:46,611
Well, well, well! 
Now who's being rude?

1286
00:47:50,697 --> 00:47:53,733
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?

1287
00:47:54,616 --> 00:47:57,255
So, what are you, 
an artist or something?

1288
00:48:00,936 --> 00:48:02,733
These are rather good.

1289
00:48:05,656 --> 00:48:08,454
They're — they're very good, actually.

1290
00:48:15,616 --> 00:48:17,527
Jack, this is exquisite work.

1291
00:48:17,616 --> 00:48:20,335
They didn't think too much
of them in old Paree.

1292
00:48:20,416 --> 00:48:21,484
Paris?

1293
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,926
You do get around for a ...

1294
00:48:28,055 --> 00:48:30,091
Well, a person of limited means.

1295
00:48:30,175 --> 00:48:32,450
Go on, a poor guy. You can say it.

1296
00:48:35,815 --> 00:48:37,373
Well, well, well.

1297
00:48:41,855 --> 00:48:44,050
And these were drawn from life?

1298
00:48:46,735 --> 00:48:48,805
That's one of the good things 
about Paris.

1299
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:51,852
Lots of girls willing to take
their clothes off.

1300
00:48:56,815 --> 00:48:58,567
You liked this woman.

1301
00:48:58,815 --> 00:49:00,805
You used her several times.

1302
00:49:03,694 --> 00:49:06,003
Well, she had beautiful hands, 
you see?

1303
00:49:08,174 --> 00:49:10,244
I think you must have had
a love affair with her.

1304
00:49:10,334 --> 00:49:12,564
No, no, no, no — just with her hands.

1305
00:49:13,094 --> 00:49:15,369
She was a one-legged prostitute.

1306
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:17,643
See?

1307
00:49:23,734 --> 00:49:26,293
She had a good sense of humor, though.

1308
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,846
And this lady ...

1309
00:49:30,813 --> 00:49:33,247
she used to sit 
at this bar every night ...

1310
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:35,847
wearing every piece of jewelry
she owned just ...

1311
00:49:35,933 --> 00:49:38,367
waiting for her long lost love.

1312
00:49:38,853 --> 00:49:40,889
We called her Madame Bijoux.

1313
00:49:41,293 --> 00:49:43,727
See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.

1314
00:49:44,893 --> 00:49:47,043
Well, you have a gift, Jack.

1315
00:49:47,853 --> 00:49:48,968
You do.

1316
00:49:49,613 --> 00:49:52,332
- You see people.
- I see you.

1317
00:49:54,733 --> 00:49:55,767
And?

1318
00:49:57,533 --> 00:49:59,489
You wouldn't have jumped.

1319
00:50:03,213 --> 00:50:06,761
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

1320
00:50:07,012 --> 00:50:08,968
Rose has already done that.

1321
00:50:09,052 --> 00:50:11,725
Look, here comes that vulgar
"Brown" woman.

1322
00:50:11,932 --> 00:50:14,571
Quickly, get up 
before she sits with us.

1323
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:18,126
Hello, girls.
I was hoping I'd catch you at tea.

1324
00:50:18,212 --> 00:50:20,282
We're awfully sorry. You missed it.

1325
00:50:20,372 --> 00:50:23,330
The Countess and I were just off
to take the air on the boat deck.

1326
00:50:23,412 --> 00:50:26,563
What a lovely idea.
I need to catch up on my gossip.

1327
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:30,880
Countess.

1328
00:50:32,331 --> 00:50:35,004
You've not yet lit 
the last 4 boilers?

1329
00:50:35,371 --> 00:50:37,248
No, I don't see the need.

1330
00:50:37,331 --> 00:50:39,367
We are making excellent time.

1331
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:41,922
The press knows the size of Titanic.

1332
00:50:42,011 --> 00:50:44,320
Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.

1333
00:50:44,411 --> 00:50:47,050
We must give them
something new to print.

1334
00:50:48,571 --> 00:50:51,688
This maiden voyage of Titanic
must make headlines.

1335
00:50:52,811 --> 00:50:54,210
Mr. Ismay ...

1336
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:59,323
I would prefer not to push the engines
until they've been properly run in.

1337
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:01,604
Of course, I'm just a passenger.

1338
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:04,329
I leave it to your good offices
to decide what's best.

1339
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:07,004
But what a glorious end
to your final crossing ...

1340
00:51:07,091 --> 00:51:10,366
if we were to get into New York
on Tuesday night and surprise them all.

1341
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:12,327
Make the morning papers.

1342
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:14,560
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?

1343
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:19,358
Good man.

1344
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:22,890
Well, after that, I worked 
on a squid boat in Monterey,

1345
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:26,243
then I went down to Los Angeles
to the pier in Santa Monica ...

1346
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:29,606
and started doing portraits there
for 10 cents a piece.

1347
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,886
Why can't I be like you, Jack?

1348
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:35,245
Just head out for the horizon
whenever I feel like it.

1349
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,927
Say we'll go there sometime, 
to that pier ...

1350
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:42,523
even if we only ever 
just talk about it.

1351
00:51:42,609 --> 00:51:45,282
No, we'll do it. 
We'll drink cheap beer,

1352
00:51:45,529 --> 00:51:48,407
we'll ride on the roller coaster
till we throw up.

1353
00:51:48,489 --> 00:51:51,561
Then we'll ride horses on the beach,
right in the surf.

1354
00:51:51,649 --> 00:51:55,642
But you'll have to do it like a real 
cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.

1355
00:51:55,969 --> 00:51:58,483
- You mean, one leg on each side?
- Yeah.

1356
00:52:00,009 --> 00:52:02,443
- Can you show me?
- Sure, if you like.

1357
00:52:04,369 --> 00:52:06,200
Teach me to ride like a man.

1358
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,165
And chew tobacco like a man.

1359
00:52:08,848 --> 00:52:10,726
And spit like a man.

1360
00:52:10,808 --> 00:52:13,197
What, they didn't teach you that
in finishing school?

1361
00:52:13,288 --> 00:52:14,277
No.

1362
00:52:15,008 --> 00:52:17,124
Come on, I'll show you. Let's do it.

1363
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:18,561
I'll show you how, come on.

1364
00:52:18,648 --> 00:52:20,445
- Jack, no.
- Come on.

1365
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:22,405
- No. Wait, Jack.
- Come on.

1366
00:52:22,728 --> 00:52:24,958
No, Jack. I couldn't possibly, Jack.

1367
00:52:25,048 --> 00:52:26,481
Watch closely.

1368
00:52:28,448 --> 00:52:30,040
That's disgusting.

1369
00:52:30,288 --> 00:52:32,006
All right, your turn.

1370
00:52:33,248 --> 00:52:35,682
That was pitiful.
Come on, you really gotta hawk it back.

1371
00:52:35,768 --> 00:52:38,327
Get some leverage to it, 
use your arms ...

1372
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:39,841
arc your neck.

1373
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:42,837
You see the range on that thing?

1374
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:44,760
Okay, go.

1375
00:52:47,807 --> 00:52:50,002
- That was better. You got to work on it.
- Really?

1376
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:53,796
Really try to hawk it up
and get some body to it. You gotta ...

1377
00:53:00,407 --> 00:53:01,556
Mother.

1378
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,757
May I introduce Jack Dawson?

1379
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:11,805
Charmed, I'm sure.

1380
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,681
The others were gracious 
and curious ...

1381
00:53:18,766 --> 00:53:21,075
about the man who'd saved my life.

1382
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:24,885
But my mother looked at him
like an insect.

1383
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:28,995
A dangerous insect
which must be squashed quickly.

1384
00:53:29,646 --> 00:53:33,639
Jack, sounds like you're a good man
to have around in a sticky spot.

1385
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,355
Why do they always insist on
announcing dinner ...

1386
00:53:38,446 --> 00:53:40,436
like a damn cavalry charge?

1387
00:53:40,806 --> 00:53:42,796
Shall we go dress, Mother?

1388
00:53:43,446 --> 00:53:45,322
See you at dinner, Jack.

1389
00:53:47,245 --> 00:53:48,280
Son?

1390
00:53:48,566 --> 00:53:49,600
Son!

1391
00:53:50,325 --> 00:53:53,522
Do you have the slightest comprehension
of what you're doing?

1392
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:54,640
Not really.

1393
00:53:54,725 --> 00:53:57,193
You're about to go into the snake pit.

1394
00:53:59,285 --> 00:54:01,435
What are you planning to wear?

1395
00:54:04,005 --> 00:54:05,677
I figured. Come on.

1396
00:54:08,325 --> 00:54:09,804
I was right.

1397
00:54:10,285 --> 00:54:12,673
You and my son
are just about the same size.

1398
00:54:12,765 --> 00:54:14,163
Pretty close.

1399
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,120
You shine up like a new penny.

1400
00:54:31,604 --> 00:54:33,196
Good evening, sir.

1401
00:55:34,562 --> 00:55:37,679
There are several thousand tons
of Hockley steel in this very ship.

1402
00:55:37,762 --> 00:55:39,957
- Which part?
- All the right ones, of course.

1403
00:55:40,042 --> 00:55:42,431
Then we'll know who to hold accountable
if there's a problem.

1404
00:55:42,522 --> 00:55:44,672
- Where's my daughter?
- She'll be along.

1405
00:55:44,762 --> 00:55:46,514
There is the Countess.

1406
00:55:46,642 --> 00:55:48,394
- Hello, my dear.
- Good evening, Cal.

1407
00:55:48,482 --> 00:55:50,278
So good to see you.

1408
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:18,270
I saw that in a nickelodeon once
and I always wanted to do it.

1409
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,392
I'll see you at dinner.

1410
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,994
Darling ...

1411
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,555
surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

1412
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,114
Dawson.

1413
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,599
That's amazing.

1414
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,474
You could almost pass 
for a gentleman.

1415
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,994
Almost.

1416
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,798
Extraordinary.

1417
00:56:56,999 --> 00:56:59,593
My dear, it's delightful to see you.

1418
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:00,993
What a remarkable voyage this is.

1419
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:03,547
- It's mad, isn't it?
- Completely lunatic.

1420
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:06,749
There's the Countess of Rothes.

1421
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:11,669
And that's John Jacob Astor ...

1422
00:57:11,959 --> 00:57:13,677
the richest man on the ship.

1423
00:57:13,759 --> 00:57:17,593
His little wifey there, Madeleine,
is my age, and in a delicate condition.

1424
00:57:18,399 --> 00:57:20,151
See how she's trying to hide it?

1425
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:21,797
Quite the scandal.

1426
00:57:22,279 --> 00:57:25,669
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim
and his mistress, Madame Aubert.

1427
00:57:25,758 --> 00:57:28,875
Mrs. Guggenheim is at home
with the children, of course.

1428
00:57:28,959 --> 00:57:32,348
And over here, we have Sir Cosmo
and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.

1429
00:57:32,438 --> 00:57:35,669
She designs naughty lingerie,
among her many talents.

1430
00:57:35,998 --> 00:57:38,114
Very popular with the royals.

1431
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:41,392
Congratulations, Hockley. 
She's splendid.

1432
00:57:41,478 --> 00:57:42,911
Why, thank you.

1433
00:57:43,398 --> 00:57:46,276
- Care to escort a lady to dinner?
- Certainly.

1434
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,277
Sweet pea?

1435
00:57:50,438 --> 00:57:53,475
Ain't nothing to it, is there, Jack?
Remember, they love money.

1436
00:57:53,558 --> 00:57:56,675
So just pretend like you own a 
gold mine and you're in the club.

1437
00:57:59,078 --> 00:58:00,305
Hey, Astor.

1438
00:58:01,397 --> 00:58:03,627
Hello, Molly, nice to see you.

1439
00:58:04,157 --> 00:58:06,671
J.J., Madeleine,
I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

1440
00:58:06,757 --> 00:58:08,190
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.

1441
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:09,710
Well, Jack ...

1442
00:58:10,117 --> 00:58:12,233
are you of the Boston Dawsons?

1443
00:58:12,677 --> 00:58:15,271
No, the Chippewa Falls 
Dawsons, actually.

1444
00:58:15,357 --> 00:58:16,506
Oh, yes.

1445
00:58:18,517 --> 00:58:21,634
He must have been nervous,
but he never faltered.

1446
00:58:23,117 --> 00:58:25,267
They assumed he was one of them.

1447
00:58:25,357 --> 00:58:27,951
Heir to a railroad fortune, perhaps.

1448
00:58:28,957 --> 00:58:32,187
New money, obviously,
but still a member of the club.

1449
00:58:33,596 --> 00:58:36,633
Mother, of course,
could always be counted upon.

1450
00:58:37,476 --> 00:58:40,434
Tell us of the accommodations
in steerage, Mr. Dawson.

1451
00:58:40,516 --> 00:58:42,234
I hear they're quite good 
on this ship.

1452
00:58:43,636 --> 00:58:46,389
The best I've seen, ma'am. 
Hardly any rats.

1453
00:58:49,596 --> 00:58:52,315
Mr. Dawson is joining us
from the third class.

1454
00:58:52,396 --> 00:58:54,785
He was of some assistance
to my fiancée last night.

1455
00:58:54,876 --> 00:58:57,629
It turns out that Mr. Dawson
is quite a fine artist.

1456
00:58:57,716 --> 00:59:00,708
He was kind enough to show me
some of his work today.

1457
00:59:00,796 --> 00:59:03,788
Rose and I differ somewhat
in our definition of fine art.

1458
00:59:03,876 --> 00:59:05,945
Not to impugn your work, sir.

1459
00:59:15,835 --> 00:59:17,029
Are these all for me?

1460
00:59:17,115 --> 00:59:19,106
Just start from the outside
and work your way in.

1461
00:59:19,195 --> 00:59:21,470
He knows every rivet in her,
don't you, Thomas?

1462
00:59:21,555 --> 00:59:24,023
Your ship is a wonder, 
Mr. Andrews. Truly.

1463
00:59:24,115 --> 00:59:25,628
Thank you, Rose.

1464
00:59:28,475 --> 00:59:29,954
How do you take your caviar, sir?

1465
00:59:30,035 --> 00:59:31,831
No caviar for me, thanks.

1466
00:59:31,915 --> 00:59:33,746
Never did like it much.

1467
00:59:34,995 --> 00:59:37,667
And where exactly do you live,
Mr. Dawson?

1468
00:59:37,834 --> 00:59:40,632
Right now, my address 
is the RMS Titanic.

1469
00:59:41,274 --> 00:59:43,424
After that, I'm on God's good humor.

1470
00:59:43,514 --> 00:59:46,074
And how is it you have means to travel?

1471
00:59:46,154 --> 00:59:48,270
I work my way from place to place.

1472
00:59:48,354 --> 00:59:50,549
You know, tramp steamers and such.

1473
00:59:50,634 --> 00:59:54,024
But I won my ticket on Titanic here
at a lucky hand at poker.

1474
00:59:54,154 --> 00:59:55,746
A very lucky hand.

1475
00:59:56,474 --> 00:59:58,510
All life is a game of luck.

1476
00:59:59,674 --> 01:00:02,507
A real man makes his own luck, 
Archie. Right, Dawson?

1477
01:00:03,954 --> 01:00:07,662
And you find that sort of rootless 
existence appealing, do you?

1478
01:00:10,593 --> 01:00:12,185
Yes, ma'am, I do.

1479
01:00:12,793 --> 01:00:15,910
I mean, I've got everything I need
right here with me.

1480
01:00:15,993 --> 01:00:19,303
I got air in my lungs
and a few blank sheets of paper.

1481
01:00:19,913 --> 01:00:23,110
I love waking up in the morning
not knowing what's gonna happen ...

1482
01:00:23,433 --> 01:00:25,230
or who I'm gonna meet ...

1483
01:00:25,313 --> 01:00:27,031
where I'm gonna wind up.

1484
01:00:27,113 --> 01:00:29,752
Just the other night I was sleeping
under a bridge, and now ...

1485
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:31,983
here I am on the grandest 
ship in the world ...

1486
01:00:32,073 --> 01:00:33,711
having champagne with you fine people.

1487
01:00:33,793 --> 01:00:35,590
I'll take some more of that.

1488
01:00:35,993 --> 01:00:39,507
I figure life is a gift
and I don't intend on wasting it.

1489
01:00:39,953 --> 01:00:42,547
You never know what hand
you're gonna get dealt next.

1490
01:00:42,632 --> 01:00:44,782
You learn to take life 
as it comes at you.

1491
01:00:44,872 --> 01:00:46,385
Here you go, Cal.

1492
01:00:47,792 --> 01:00:49,589
To make each day count.

1493
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:52,388
- Well said, Jack.
- Hear, hear.

1494
01:00:53,432 --> 01:00:55,150
To making it count.

1495
01:00:56,312 --> 01:00:57,984
To making it count!

1496
01:00:58,592 --> 01:00:59,741
Bravo.

1497
01:01:05,872 --> 01:01:09,421
But Mr. Brown had no idea
I'd hidden the money in the stove.

1498
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:14,585
So he comes home drunk as a pig,
celebrating, and he lights a fire.

1499
01:01:17,151 --> 01:01:18,186
Bravo.

1500
01:01:18,271 --> 01:01:20,910
Next it'll be brandies 
in the smoking room.

1501
01:01:22,351 --> 01:01:25,343
- Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?
- What a good idea.

1502
01:01:25,871 --> 01:01:29,022
Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke
and congratulate each other ...

1503
01:01:29,111 --> 01:01:30,703
on being masters of the universe.

1504
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:33,669
Ladies, thank you for the pleasure
of your company.

1505
01:01:33,751 --> 01:01:35,309
Rose, may I escort you to the cabin?

1506
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:37,063
No, I'll stay here.

1507
01:01:37,271 --> 01:01:38,943
Here you go, Molly.

1508
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:41,149
Joining us, Dawson?

1509
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:44,427
You don't want to stay out here
with the women, do you?

1510
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:47,786
- No, thanks, I've got to be heading back.
- Probably best.

1511
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,259
It'll be all business and politics,
that sort of thing.

1512
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:52,147
Wouldn't interest you.

1513
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:53,709
But, Dawson ...

1514
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:55,828
good of you to come.

1515
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:01,703
Jack, must you go?

1516
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:04,588
Time for me to go row
with the other slaves.

1517
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:08,822
Good night, Rose.

1518
01:02:47,188 --> 01:02:49,383
So you want to go to a real party?

1519
01:02:59,588 --> 01:03:02,022
Is okay if I put my hand here? Okay.

1520
01:03:16,548 --> 01:03:17,617
What?

1521
01:03:20,227 --> 01:03:22,024
I can't understand you.

1522
01:03:53,146 --> 01:03:55,580
I'm going to dance 
with her now, all right?

1523
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:56,815
Come on.

1524
01:03:56,906 --> 01:03:58,339
- What?
- Come on.

1525
01:03:58,426 --> 01:04:00,735
- Come with me.
- Jack! Jack, wait.

1526
01:04:03,346 --> 01:04:04,540
I can't do this.

1527
01:04:04,626 --> 01:04:07,936
We're gonna have to get
a little bit closer, like this.

1528
01:04:10,706 --> 01:04:12,981
You're still my best girl, Cora.

1529
01:04:15,626 --> 01:04:18,777
- I don't know the steps.
- Neither do I, just go with it.

1530
01:04:18,866 --> 01:04:20,219
Don't think.

1531
01:04:38,505 --> 01:04:41,144
Wait, Jack! Stop!

1532
01:04:50,504 --> 01:04:51,904
Stop! Wait!

1533
01:05:31,623 --> 01:05:33,295
Jack, no.

1534
01:05:39,023 --> 01:05:41,014
... beyond the jurisdiction
of the Sherman Act.

1535
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,741
So my lawyers will argue.

1536
01:05:42,823 --> 01:05:46,179
That's what Rockefeller said, but
the Supreme Court is not swallowing it.

1537
01:06:05,582 --> 01:06:06,651
What?

1538
01:06:06,742 --> 01:06:09,415
You think a first-class girl 
can't drink?

1539
01:06:11,462 --> 01:06:12,975
Get out of here.

1540
01:06:13,062 --> 01:06:14,620
You all right?

1541
01:06:16,182 --> 01:06:17,297
I'm fine.

1542
01:06:17,382 --> 01:06:18,940
2 out of 3.

1543
01:06:20,342 --> 01:06:21,377
So ...

1544
01:06:22,622 --> 01:06:24,852
you think you're big tough men?

1545
01:06:25,742 --> 01:06:27,538
Let's see you do this.

1546
01:06:29,301 --> 01:06:31,690
Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.

1547
01:06:48,821 --> 01:06:50,539
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1548
01:06:50,621 --> 01:06:53,658
- Are you all right?
- I haven't done that in years.

1549
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:29,773
Coffee, sir?

1550
01:07:39,299 --> 01:07:41,813
I had hoped you would come to me
last night.

1551
01:07:42,979 --> 01:07:44,298
I was tired.

1552
01:07:47,059 --> 01:07:50,369
Your exertions below decks were,
no doubt, exhausting.

1553
01:07:52,299 --> 01:07:56,133
I see you had that undertaker
of a manservant follow me. How typical.

1554
01:07:56,219 --> 01:07:59,973
You will never behave like that again,
Rose, do you understand?

1555
01:08:02,218 --> 01:08:05,767
I'm not a foreman in one of 
your mills that you can command.

1556
01:08:06,738 --> 01:08:08,296
I'm your fiancée.

1557
01:08:10,898 --> 01:08:12,456
My fiancée!

1558
01:08:12,778 --> 01:08:14,689
Yes, you are, and my wife!

1559
01:08:15,338 --> 01:08:19,377
My wife in practice, if not yet 
by law. So you will honor me.

1560
01:08:19,858 --> 01:08:22,850
You'll honor me the way a wife 
is required to honor her husband.

1561
01:08:22,938 --> 01:08:25,657
Because I will not be made
out a fool, Rose.

1562
01:08:25,738 --> 01:08:27,729
Is this in any way unclear?

1563
01:08:28,498 --> 01:08:29,487
No.

1564
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:32,173
Good. Excuse me.

1565
01:08:37,577 --> 01:08:38,852
Miss Rose.

1566
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:43,177
- We had a little accident.
- That's all right, Miss Rose.

1567
01:08:43,257 --> 01:08:44,849
- Sorry, Trudy.
- It's all right.

1568
01:08:44,937 --> 01:08:46,211
Let me help you.

1569
01:08:46,297 --> 01:08:48,015
It's all right, miss.

1570
01:08:53,817 --> 01:08:55,216
It's all right, miss.

1571
01:09:00,897 --> 01:09:03,286
- Tea, Trudy.
- Yes, ma'am.

1572
01:09:18,816 --> 01:09:21,967
You are not to see that boy again.
Do you understand me?

1573
01:09:23,136 --> 01:09:25,411
Rose, I forbid it.

1574
01:09:26,376 --> 01:09:29,493
Stop it, Mother.
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

1575
01:09:29,576 --> 01:09:31,248
This is not a game.

1576
01:09:31,696 --> 01:09:33,766
Our situation is precarious.

1577
01:09:33,856 --> 01:09:35,335
You know the money's gone.

1578
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:37,452
Of course I know it's gone.

1579
01:09:37,935 --> 01:09:39,813
You remind me every day.

1580
01:09:40,535 --> 01:09:45,086
Your father left us nothing but a legacy
of bad debts hidden by a good name.

1581
01:09:45,575 --> 01:09:48,294
That name is the only card
we have to play.

1582
01:09:48,775 --> 01:09:50,606
I don't understand you.

1583
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:54,570
It is a fine match with Hockley.
It will ensure our survival.

1584
01:09:56,135 --> 01:09:58,012
How can you put this on my shoulders?

1585
01:09:58,095 --> 01:09:59,813
Why are you being so selfish?

1586
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:01,487
I'm being selfish?

1587
01:10:04,895 --> 01:10:07,773
Do you want to see me working
as a seamstress?

1588
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,251
Is that what you want?

1589
01:10:13,654 --> 01:10:16,248
To see our fine things 
sold at auction?

1590
01:10:18,094 --> 01:10:20,483
Our memories scattered to the winds?

1591
01:10:30,534 --> 01:10:32,092
It's so unfair.

1592
01:10:33,694 --> 01:10:35,571
Of course it's unfair.

1593
01:10:36,534 --> 01:10:37,853
We're women.

1594
01:10:40,294 --> 01:10:42,330

- Hello, Mr. Andrews.
- Hello, Jack.

1603
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:51,202
I just need to talk to somebody
for a second.

1604
01:11:51,292 --> 01:11:54,647
- Sir, you're not supposed to be in here.
- I just need to speak to someone.

1605
01:11:57,611 --> 01:11:59,522
I was just here last night,
you don't remember me?

1606
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:00,646
No, I'm afraid I don't.

1607
01:12:00,731 --> 01:12:03,199
- Now, you're gonna have to turn around.
- He'll tell you.

1608
01:12:03,291 --> 01:12:04,644
I just need to talk —

1609
01:12:04,731 --> 01:12:07,450
Mr. Hockley and Mrs. Dewitt Bukater ...

1610
01:12:08,131 --> 01:12:10,725
continue to be appreciative
of your assistance.

1611
01:12:11,051 --> 01:12:14,487
They asked me to give you this
in gratitude.

1612
01:12:14,571 --> 01:12:16,243
I don't want your money. Please. 
I just —

1613
01:12:16,331 --> 01:12:19,447
Also to remind you
that you hold a third-class ticket ...

1614
01:12:19,531 --> 01:12:22,283
and that your presence here
is no longer appropriate.

1615
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:24,406
Please, I just wanna speak 
to Rose for one second.

1616
01:12:24,491 --> 01:12:28,199
Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson
gets back to where he belongs ...

1617
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:30,167
and that he stays there.

1618
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:32,521
Yes, sir. Come along, you.

1619
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:37,529

1621
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,486
And why do you have
2 steering wheels?

1622
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:48,004
- We really only use this near shore.
- Excuse me, sir.

1623
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:50,650
Another ice warning.
This one is from the Noordam.

1624
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:52,367
Thank you, Sparks.

1625
01:12:54,209 --> 01:12:57,679
Not to worry.
Quite normal for this time of year.

1626
01:12:58,249 --> 01:13:02,003
In fact, we're speeding up.
I've just ordered the last boilers lit.

1627
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:09,006
Okay, son, wind it up tight
like I showed you. That's right.

1628
01:13:09,089 --> 01:13:10,807
Okay, now, let it go.

1629
01:13:16,689 --> 01:13:18,281
That's excellent.

1630
01:13:22,288 --> 01:13:24,757
Mr. Andrews, forgive me ...

1631
01:13:25,649 --> 01:13:27,525
I did the sum in my head ...

1632
01:13:27,608 --> 01:13:31,396
and with the number of lifeboats
times the capacity you mentioned ...

1633
01:13:31,488 --> 01:13:35,242
Forgive me, but it seems that there are
not enough for everyone aboard.

1634
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:37,046
About half, actually.

1635
01:13:37,768 --> 01:13:39,963
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?

1636
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:42,437
In fact, I put in 
these new-type davits ...

1637
01:13:42,528 --> 01:13:45,645
which can take an extra row of boats
inside this one.

1638
01:13:45,728 --> 01:13:47,878
But it was thought, by some ...

1639
01:13:47,968 --> 01:13:49,799
the deck would look too cluttered.

1640
01:13:49,888 --> 01:13:51,560
So, I was overruled.

1641
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:55,359
It's a waste of deck space as it is
in an unsinkable ship.

1642
01:13:55,448 --> 01:13:57,244
Sleep soundly, young Rose.

1643
01:13:57,328 --> 01:14:00,125
I have built you a good ship,
strong and true.

1644
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:02,004
She's all the lifeboat you need.

1645
01:14:02,087 --> 01:14:05,159
Keep heading aft.
The next stop will be the engine room.

1646
01:14:05,247 --> 01:14:06,396
Come on.

1647
01:14:11,367 --> 01:14:14,325
Jack, this is impossible. 
I can't see you.

1648
01:14:14,407 --> 01:14:16,682
- I need to talk to you.
- No, Jack. No.

1649
01:14:18,647 --> 01:14:20,558
Jack, I'm engaged.

1650
01:14:21,847 --> 01:14:23,405
I'm marrying Cal.

1651
01:14:24,327 --> 01:14:25,646
I love Cal.

1652
01:14:29,326 --> 01:14:31,681
Rose, you're no picnic, all right?

1653
01:14:31,766 --> 01:14:34,155
You're a spoiled little brat, even.

1654
01:14:34,246 --> 01:14:37,079
But under that,
you're the most amazingly ...

1655
01:14:37,646 --> 01:14:39,955
astounding, wonderful girl ...

1656
01:14:40,566 --> 01:14:43,205
Woman that I've ever known and —

1657
01:14:43,286 --> 01:14:45,481
- Jack, I —
- No, let me try to get this out.

1658
01:14:45,566 --> 01:14:46,885
You're making ...

1659
01:14:49,126 --> 01:14:52,004
I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.

1660
01:14:52,086 --> 01:14:53,883
I've got $10 in my pocket.

1661
01:14:53,966 --> 01:14:56,799
I have nothing to offer you
and I know that.

1662
01:14:57,086 --> 01:14:58,485
I understand.

1663
01:14:59,566 --> 01:15:01,442
But I'm too involved now.

1664
01:15:01,525 --> 01:15:03,436
You jump, I jump, remember?

1665
01:15:03,525 --> 01:15:06,801
I can't turn away without knowing
you'll be all right.

1666
01:15:07,365 --> 01:15:09,196
That's all that I want.

1667
01:15:10,165 --> 01:15:11,678
Well, I'm fine.

1668
01:15:12,645 --> 01:15:14,556
I'll be fine. Really.

1669
01:15:15,885 --> 01:15:17,034
Really?

1670
01:15:18,885 --> 01:15:20,477
I don't think so.

1671
01:15:21,685 --> 01:15:23,198
They have got you trapped, Rose.

1672
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:25,276
And you're gonna die
if you don't break free.

1673
01:15:25,365 --> 01:15:28,162
Maybe not right away,
because you're strong ...

1674
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:32,673
but sooner or later, that fire 
that I love about you, Rose ...

1675
01:15:32,765 --> 01:15:34,880
that fire's going to burn out.

1676
01:15:39,844 --> 01:15:42,233
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.

1677
01:15:43,564 --> 01:15:44,997
You're right.

1678
01:15:46,084 --> 01:15:47,836
Only you can do that.

1679
01:15:53,764 --> 01:15:56,278
I'm going back. Leave me alone.

1680
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:11,280
Tell Lucile about the disaster 
you had with the stationers.

1681
01:16:11,363 --> 01:16:14,002
Of course, the invitations had to be
sent back, twice.

1682
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:16,961
- Oh, my dear.
- And the dreadful bridesmaids' gowns.

1683
01:16:17,043 --> 01:16:19,477
Let me tell you,
what an odyssey that has been.

1684
01:16:19,563 --> 01:16:23,272
Rose decided she wanted lavender.
She knows I detest the color.

1685
01:16:23,363 --> 01:16:25,399
She did it to spite me.

1686
01:16:25,483 --> 01:16:27,599
If only you'd come to me sooner.

1687
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:29,913
Ruth saw some of my designs
in La Mode lllustrée ...

1688
01:16:30,003 --> 01:16:31,152
they were for the trousseau ...

1689
01:16:31,243 --> 01:16:34,235
of the Duchess of Marlborough's youngest
daughter. They were quite charming.

1690
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:36,552
I think you'll agree, my dear,
that together ...

1691
01:16:37,202 --> 01:16:39,921
we've created something 
of a phoenix from the ashes.

1692
01:16:54,162 --> 01:16:55,515
Hello, Jack.

1693
01:17:00,802 --> 01:17:02,394
I changed my mind.

1694
01:17:08,322 --> 01:17:10,438
They said you might be up here —

1695
01:17:12,121 --> 01:17:13,759
Give me your hand.

1696
01:17:20,681 --> 01:17:22,399
Now close your eyes.

1697
01:17:23,401 --> 01:17:24,550
Go on.

1698
01:17:27,681 --> 01:17:29,034
Now step up.

1699
01:17:32,961 --> 01:17:35,680
Now hold on to the railing.
Keep your eyes closed.

1700
01:17:35,761 --> 01:17:37,479
- Don't peek.
- I'm not.

1701
01:17:38,721 --> 01:17:40,552
Step up onto the rail.

1702
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,590
Hold on. Hold on.

1703
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,591
Keep your eyes closed.

1704
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:51,753
- Do you trust me?
- I trust you.

1705
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,233
All right, open your eyes.

1706
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,069
I'm flying. Jack.

1707
01:18:37,239 --> 01:18:40,834
♪ Come, Josephine, 
in my flying machine ♪

1708
01:18:40,918 --> 01:18:45,673
♪ Going up she goes, up she goes ♪

1709
01:19:31,557 --> 01:19:34,629
That was the last time Titanic
ever saw daylight.

1710
01:19:35,477 --> 01:19:38,196
We're up to dusk, 
the night of the sinking.

1711
01:19:38,437 --> 01:19:40,553
- 6 hours to go.
- Incredible.

1712
01:19:40,757 --> 01:19:42,429
There's Smith, 
and he's standing there ...

1713
01:19:42,517 --> 01:19:44,906
and he's got the iceberg warning
in his fucking hand.

1714
01:19:44,997 --> 01:19:47,749
Excuse me, his hand,
and he's ordering more speed.

1715
01:19:47,836 --> 01:19:50,555
26 years of experience working
against him.

1716
01:19:51,116 --> 01:19:55,234
He figures anything big enough to sink
the ship, they're gonna see in time to turn.

1717
01:19:55,316 --> 01:19:57,955
But the ship's too big
with too small a rudder.

1718
01:19:58,036 --> 01:20:00,106
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1719
01:20:00,596 --> 01:20:02,666
Everything he knows is wrong.

1720
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:18,346
It's quite proper, I assure you.
This is the sitting room.

1721
01:20:20,395 --> 01:20:22,545
- Will this light do?
- What?

1722
01:20:22,875 --> 01:20:25,025
Don't artists need good light?

1723
01:20:25,115 --> 01:20:28,790
That is true, but I'm not used to working
in such horrible conditions.

1724
01:20:29,915 --> 01:20:31,064
Monet!

1725
01:20:32,235 --> 01:20:34,351
- You know his work?
- Of course.

1726
01:20:34,795 --> 01:20:37,184
Look at his use of color here.
Isn't he great?

1727
01:20:37,275 --> 01:20:39,266
I know. It's extraordinary.

1728
01:20:41,395 --> 01:20:44,671
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

1729
01:20:45,075 --> 01:20:47,714
Should we be expecting him
anytime soon?

1730
01:20:48,395 --> 01:20:51,272
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.

1731
01:20:54,794 --> 01:20:57,513
That's nice. What is it, a sapphire?

1732
01:20:58,434 --> 01:21:01,392
A diamond. A very rare diamond.

1733
01:21:05,154 --> 01:21:08,669
Jack, I want you to draw me
like one of your French girls.

1734
01:21:09,034 --> 01:21:11,594
- Wearing this.
- All right.

1735
01:21:13,394 --> 01:21:14,986
Wearing only this.

1736
01:21:48,873 --> 01:21:50,545
The last thing I need ...

1737
01:21:50,632 --> 01:21:53,943
is another picture of me
looking like a porcelain doll.

1738
01:21:56,713 --> 01:21:58,623
As a paying customer ...

1739
01:22:00,312 --> 01:22:02,382
I expect to get what I want.

1740
01:22:19,552 --> 01:22:22,066
Over on the bed. The couch.

1741
01:22:30,511 --> 01:22:32,229
Lie down.

1742
01:22:36,071 --> 01:22:39,700
- Tell me when it looks right.
- Put your arm back the way it was.

1743
01:22:41,351 --> 01:22:44,707
Put that other arm up,
that hand right by your face there.

1744
01:22:46,111 --> 01:22:47,260
Right.

1745
01:22:47,871 --> 01:22:49,623
Now, head down.

1746
01:22:51,911 --> 01:22:54,027
Eyes to me, keep them on me.

1747
01:22:56,030 --> 01:22:57,783
And try to stay still.

1748
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:17,309
So serious.

1749
01:23:57,589 --> 01:24:00,422
I believe you are blushing, 
Mr. Big Artiste.

1750
01:24:04,709 --> 01:24:07,381
I can't imagine 
Monsieur Monet blushing.

1751
01:24:08,588 --> 01:24:10,260
He does landscapes.

1752
01:24:11,108 --> 01:24:13,383
- Just relax your face.
- Sorry.

1753
01:24:13,468 --> 01:24:14,787
No laughing.

1754
01:24:44,507 --> 01:24:47,021
My heart was pounding the whole time.

1755
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:51,097
It was the most erotic 
moment of my life ...

1756
01:24:54,787 --> 01:24:56,743
up until then, at least.

1757
01:24:57,867 --> 01:24:59,664
So what happened next?

1758
01:25:00,307 --> 01:25:02,775
You mean, did we do it?

1759
01:25:06,466 --> 01:25:08,138
Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.

1760
01:25:08,227 --> 01:25:10,263
Jack was very professional.

1761
01:25:17,626 --> 01:25:18,945
Thank you.

1762
01:25:26,946 --> 01:25:28,618
What are you doing?

1763
01:25:29,026 --> 01:25:31,779
Will you put this back 
in the safe for me?

1764
01:25:42,985 --> 01:25:45,021
- Gentlemen, would you excuse me?
- Sure.

1765
01:25:47,025 --> 01:25:49,414
None of the stewards have seen her.

1766
01:25:49,905 --> 01:25:52,260
This is absurd. It's a ship.

1767
01:25:52,345 --> 01:25:54,620
There's only so many places 
she could be.

1768
01:25:54,705 --> 01:25:56,297
Lovejoy, find her.

1769
01:26:13,265 --> 01:26:14,697
- Clear.
- Yes.

1770
01:26:15,904 --> 01:26:18,816
I don't think I've ever seen
such a flat calm.

1771
01:26:20,024 --> 01:26:23,175
Like a mill pond. 
Not a breath of wind.

1772
01:26:24,464 --> 01:26:27,103
It will make 
the 'bergs harder to see ...

1773
01:26:27,384 --> 01:26:29,818
with no breaking water at the base.

1774
01:26:40,704 --> 01:26:42,137
Well, I'm off.

1775
01:26:42,224 --> 01:26:44,943
Maintain speed and heading,
Mr. Lightoller.

1776
01:26:45,263 --> 01:26:46,458
Yes, sir.

1777
01:26:57,263 --> 01:26:58,855
It's getting cold.

1778
01:26:59,063 --> 01:27:00,974
- You look nice.
- Miss Rose?

1779
01:27:02,023 --> 01:27:03,342
My drawings.

1780
01:27:28,382 --> 01:27:29,576
Come on, Jack!

1781
01:27:32,982 --> 01:27:34,859
- Wait!
- Wait!

1782
01:27:35,942 --> 01:27:38,058
- Go!
- Take us down, quick.

1783
01:27:38,142 --> 01:27:39,575
- Go!
- Quickly! Quickly!

1784
01:27:44,742 --> 01:27:45,776
Bye.

1785
01:27:53,261 --> 01:27:54,250
Sorry.

1786
01:27:59,581 --> 01:28:01,572
- Keep going.
- Thank you, I've got it.

1787
01:28:11,381 --> 01:28:13,895
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.

1788
01:28:13,981 --> 01:28:16,541
- Seems more like a cop.
- I think he was.

1789
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:18,659
- Oh, shit.
- Go!

1790
01:28:23,181 --> 01:28:25,614
- No, over here!
- Quick!

1791
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:34,695
- Now what?
- What?

1792
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:43,288
More coal for number one, mate.

1793
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:45,530
What are you two doing down here?

1794
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:47,895
You shouldn't be down here.
It could be dangerous!

1795
01:28:51,579 --> 01:28:53,774
Carry on. Don't mind us.

1796
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:56,817
You're doing a great job.
Keep up the good work!

1797
01:29:12,019 --> 01:29:14,010
Look at what we have here.

1798
01:29:31,578 --> 01:29:32,806
Thank you.

1799
01:29:43,978 --> 01:29:45,457
Where to, miss?

1800
01:29:46,818 --> 01:29:48,251
To the stars.

1801
01:30:06,497 --> 01:30:07,850
You nervous?

1802
01:30:10,217 --> 01:30:11,252
No.

1803
01:30:27,497 --> 01:30:29,533
Put your hands on me, Jack.

1804
01:30:53,216 --> 01:30:54,729
It's bloody cold.

1805
01:30:54,816 --> 01:30:57,488
You know, I can smell ice, you know.
When it's near.

1806
01:30:59,455 --> 01:31:01,969
- Bollocks!
- Well, I can, all right?

1807
01:31:02,895 --> 01:31:05,125
Did you ever find those binoculars
for the lookouts?

1808
01:31:05,215 --> 01:31:07,649
Haven't seen them since Southampton.

1809
01:31:07,735 --> 01:31:10,124
Well, I'll be on my rounds. Cheerio.

1810
01:31:40,534 --> 01:31:42,126
You're trembling.

1811
01:31:43,974 --> 01:31:46,613
Don't worry, I'll be all right.

1812
01:32:07,733 --> 01:32:10,008
- They ran down there.
- All right.

1813
01:32:18,813 --> 01:32:20,371
Anything missing?

1814
01:32:44,212 --> 01:32:46,123
I've got a better idea.

1815
01:32:58,412 --> 01:32:59,401
Gotcha!

1816
01:33:08,332 --> 01:33:10,447
Did you see those guys' faces?

1817
01:33:11,611 --> 01:33:13,169
Did you see them?

1818
01:33:19,491 --> 01:33:21,322
When the ship docks ...

1819
01:33:22,611 --> 01:33:24,567
I'm getting off with you.

1820
01:33:25,371 --> 01:33:27,248
- This is crazy.
- I know.

1821
01:33:27,331 --> 01:33:29,242
It doesn't make any sense.

1822
01:33:30,731 --> 01:33:32,527
That's why I trust it.

1823
01:33:41,970 --> 01:33:43,642
Here, look at this.

1824
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:46,241
Look at that, would you?

1825
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:48,321
They're a bit warmer than we are.

1826
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:50,844
If that's what it takes for us
to get warm, I'd rather not ...

1827
01:33:50,930 --> 01:33:52,727
if it's all the same to you, all right?

1828
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:06,241
Bugger me!

1829
01:34:10,889 --> 01:34:12,686
Pick up, you bastards!

1830
01:34:15,849 --> 01:34:18,079
- Is anyone there?
- Yes, what do you see?

1831
01:34:18,169 --> 01:34:20,478
- Iceberg, right ahead!
- Thank you.

1832
01:34:23,009 --> 01:34:24,328
Iceberg, right ahead!

1833
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:26,081
Hard to starboard!

1834
01:34:32,929 --> 01:34:35,318
Turn! Smartly!

1835
01:34:39,929 --> 01:34:41,282
Full astern!

1836
01:34:43,368 --> 01:34:45,723
- Hard over.
- Helm's hard over, sir.

1837
01:34:49,368 --> 01:34:50,801
Go, lads, go!

1838
01:34:53,448 --> 01:34:55,962
Bring that steam down! 
Bring it down!

1839
01:34:57,848 --> 01:35:00,237
Shut all the dampers! Shut them!

1840
01:35:04,808 --> 01:35:06,036
Hold it.

1841
01:35:10,048 --> 01:35:12,322
Now! Engage the reversing engine.

1842
01:35:39,647 --> 01:35:41,443
Why ain't they turning?

1843
01:35:41,527 --> 01:35:44,404
- Is it hard over?
- It is. Yes, sir, hard over.

1844
01:35:49,446 --> 01:35:52,563
Come on. Come on. Turn.

1845
01:36:03,046 --> 01:36:04,035
Yes.

1846
01:36:09,406 --> 01:36:10,885
It's gonna hit!

1847
01:36:21,885 --> 01:36:23,284
Jesus Christ!

1848
01:36:43,205 --> 01:36:44,558
Jesus.

1849
01:36:44,645 --> 01:36:47,079
- Hard to port!
- Hard to port!

1850
01:36:56,724 --> 01:36:57,918
Get back!

1851
01:37:25,923 --> 01:37:27,356
Come on, let's go!

1852
01:37:27,443 --> 01:37:29,877
Get out of the door.
They're closing the doors!

1853
01:37:29,963 --> 01:37:31,157
Get out!

1854
01:37:37,043 --> 01:37:39,238
Get out of the door! Go!

1855
01:37:40,123 --> 01:37:42,842
Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!

1856
01:37:54,763 --> 01:37:55,797
Out!

1857
01:38:09,882 --> 01:38:11,156
Oh, my God.

1858
01:38:12,482 --> 01:38:14,074
That was a close shave, wasn't it?

1859
01:38:14,162 --> 01:38:16,596
Smell ice, can you? Bleeding Christ!

1860
01:38:20,922 --> 01:38:23,436
Note the time and enter it in the log.

1861
01:38:28,961 --> 01:38:30,997
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

1862
01:38:31,481 --> 01:38:33,039
An iceberg, sir.

1863
01:38:33,881 --> 01:38:37,635
I put her hard to starboard, and ran the
engines full astern, but it was too close.

1864
01:38:37,721 --> 01:38:39,916
I tried to port round it, but she hit.

1865
01:38:40,001 --> 01:38:43,152
- Close the watertight doors.
- Doors are closed, sir.

1866
01:38:45,841 --> 01:38:47,559
- All stop.
- Aye, sir.

1867
01:38:55,681 --> 01:38:57,672
Find the carpenter.
Get him to sound the ship.

1868
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:58,954
Yes, sir.

1869
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,396
Come on, let's get the hell 
out of here.

1870
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:12,515
Come on, hurry up.

1871
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:19,157
Excuse me,
why have the engines stopped?

1872
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:21,231
- I felt a shudder.
- I shouldn't worry, madam.

1873
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:24,232
We've likely thrown a propeller blade.
That's the shudder you felt.

1874
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:26,117
May I bring you anything?

1875
01:39:26,199 --> 01:39:27,268
No, thank you.

1876
01:39:32,359 --> 01:39:34,634
So, now there's talk of an iceberg.
Did you see anything?

1877
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,516
I don't see anything now. Do you?

1878
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:41,470
If this is the direction the rats 
are going, that's good enough for me.

1879
01:39:44,359 --> 01:39:46,350
Everything's under control.

1880
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:50,195
- You there.
- Sir, there is no emergency.

1881
01:39:50,279 --> 01:39:51,917
Yes, there is. I've been robbed.

1882
01:39:51,999 --> 01:39:53,478
Get the master-at-arms.

1883
01:39:53,559 --> 01:39:55,436
- Now, you moron!
- Yes, sir.

1884
01:39:58,559 --> 01:40:00,435
Hey, did I miss the fun?

1885
01:40:01,918 --> 01:40:03,874
- Did you see what happened?
- No, I missed it.

1886
01:40:03,959 --> 01:40:06,075
Apparently, it hit over there.

1887
01:40:06,278 --> 01:40:08,838
Boiler Room 6 is flooded
8 feet above the plate ...

1888
01:40:08,918 --> 01:40:10,954
and the mail hold is worse.
She's all buckled in —

1889
01:40:11,038 --> 01:40:13,108
- Can you shore up?
- Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1890
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:14,870
Have you seen the damage
in the mail hold?

1891
01:40:14,958 --> 01:40:17,074
No, she's already underwater.

1892
01:40:17,158 --> 01:40:18,511
This is bad.

1893
01:40:20,718 --> 01:40:22,390
We should tell Mother and Cal.

1894
01:40:23,478 --> 01:40:25,673
I think they're very good, sir.

1895
01:40:28,238 --> 01:40:31,708
Don't touch anything.
I want the entire room photographed.

1896
01:40:36,077 --> 01:40:38,352
We've been looking for you, miss.

1897
01:40:42,477 --> 01:40:43,546
Here we go.

1898
01:40:49,477 --> 01:40:51,672
Something serious has happened.

1899
01:40:52,237 --> 01:40:53,636
Yes, it has.

1900
01:40:54,957 --> 01:40:55,992
Indeed.

1901
01:40:56,077 --> 01:40:58,386
Two things dear to me
have disappeared this evening.

1902
01:40:58,477 --> 01:41:01,593
Now that one is back, I have a pretty 
good idea where to find the other.

1903
01:41:01,677 --> 01:41:02,711
Search him.

1904
01:41:02,797 --> 01:41:04,388
- Take your coat off, son.
- Now what?

1905
01:41:04,477 --> 01:41:05,704
Come on, now.

1906
01:41:05,796 --> 01:41:07,594
Cal, what are you doing?

1907
01:41:07,676 --> 01:41:09,906
We're in the middle of an emergency.
What's going on?

1908
01:41:09,996 --> 01:41:12,066
- Is this it?
- That's it.

1909
01:41:12,676 --> 01:41:14,268
This is horseshit!

1910
01:41:15,116 --> 01:41:16,868
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't.

1911
01:41:16,956 --> 01:41:18,867
- He couldn't have.
- Of course he could.

1912
01:41:18,956 --> 01:41:20,548
It's easy enough for a professional.

1913
01:41:20,636 --> 01:41:23,275
But I was with him the whole time.
This is absurd.

1914
01:41:23,356 --> 01:41:27,315
Perhaps he did it while you were putting
your clothes back on, dear.

1915
01:41:27,716 --> 01:41:29,866
Real slick, Cal.
Rose, they put it in my pocket.

1916
01:41:29,956 --> 01:41:32,868
- Shut up.
- It isn't even your pocket. Is it, son?

1917
01:41:32,955 --> 01:41:34,947
"Property of A.L. Ryerson."

1918
01:41:38,555 --> 01:41:39,955
That was reported stolen today.

1919
01:41:40,035 --> 01:41:41,866
I just borrowed it. 
I was gonna return it.

1920
01:41:41,955 --> 01:41:44,344
An honest thief.
We have an honest thief here, do we?

1921
01:41:44,435 --> 01:41:47,233
You know I didn't do this, Rose.
You know it.

1922
01:41:47,395 --> 01:41:49,033
Don't believe them, Rose. You know it.

1923
01:41:49,115 --> 01:41:51,948
- You know I didn't do it.
- Come on, son. Let's go.

1924
01:41:52,035 --> 01:41:54,424
- Rose!
- Come on, there's a good lad.

1925
01:41:54,915 --> 01:41:56,030
Come on.

1926
01:41:56,115 --> 01:41:58,310
You know I didn't do it. You know me!

1927
01:41:59,555 --> 01:42:01,511
This is most unfortunate, Captain.

1928
01:42:05,394 --> 01:42:08,466
Water 14 feet above the keel
in 10 minutes ...

1929
01:42:09,154 --> 01:42:12,306
in the forepeak, in all 3 holds,
and in Boiler Room 6.

1930
01:42:12,394 --> 01:42:15,227
- That's right, sir.
- When can we get underway, damn it?

1931
01:42:15,314 --> 01:42:17,270
That's 5 compartments.

1932
01:42:18,914 --> 01:42:21,428
She can stay afloat with the 
first 4 compartments breached ...

1933
01:42:21,514 --> 01:42:22,913
but not 5.

1934
01:42:23,354 --> 01:42:24,548
Not 5.

1935
01:42:24,754 --> 01:42:26,267
As she goes down by the head ...

1936
01:42:26,354 --> 01:42:29,505
the water will spill over the tops 
of the bulkheads at "E" deck ...

1937
01:42:29,834 --> 01:42:32,143
from one to the next, back and back.

1938
01:42:32,314 --> 01:42:34,111
There's no stopping it.

1939
01:42:34,194 --> 01:42:35,513
The pumps. We open the pumps ...

1940
01:42:35,594 --> 01:42:38,267
The pumps buy you time,
but minutes only.

1941
01:42:39,313 --> 01:42:41,589
From this moment,
no matter what we do ...

1942
01:42:42,353 --> 01:42:44,071
Titanic will founder.

1943
01:42:46,673 --> 01:42:48,072
But this ship can't sink.

1944
01:42:48,153 --> 01:42:51,941
She's made of iron, sir.
I assure you, she can. And she will.

1945
01:42:53,033 --> 01:42:54,910
It is a mathematical certainty.

1946
01:42:59,393 --> 01:43:00,826
How much time?

1947
01:43:07,992 --> 01:43:10,188
An hour. Two, at most.

1948
01:43:16,232 --> 01:43:18,541
And how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?

1949
01:43:18,712 --> 01:43:20,942
2,200 souls on board, sir.

1950
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:30,910
Well, I believe you may 
get your headlines, Mr. Ismay.

1951
01:43:48,110 --> 01:43:50,340
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?

1952
01:43:51,070 --> 01:43:53,061
You look at me 
when I'm talking to you!

1953
01:43:53,230 --> 01:43:55,347
- Mr. Hockley?
- Not now. We're busy.

1954
01:43:55,431 --> 01:43:58,150
Sir, I've been told to ask you
to put on your lifebelts ...

1955
01:43:58,231 --> 01:44:00,222
and come up to the boat deck.
- I said, not now.

1956
01:44:00,311 --> 01:44:03,303
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,
Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.

1957
01:44:03,391 --> 01:44:05,269
Now please, dress warmly.

1958
01:44:05,552 --> 01:44:07,622
It's quite cold out tonight.

1959
01:44:07,992 --> 01:44:10,506
Now, may I suggest topcoats and hats?

1960
01:44:10,992 --> 01:44:12,664
This is ridiculous.

1961
01:44:13,352 --> 01:44:16,629
Not to worry, miss.
I'm sure it's just a precaution.

1962
01:44:17,073 --> 01:44:18,904
Everybody up. Lifebelts on.

1963
01:44:20,913 --> 01:44:22,631
What's he on about?

1964
01:44:22,713 --> 01:44:24,988
- Everybody up. Put your lifebelts on.
- What's the ruckus?

1965
01:44:25,073 --> 01:44:26,348
Just put your lifebelts on.

1966
01:44:27,794 --> 01:44:28,783
CQD?

1967
01:44:29,474 --> 01:44:30,543
Sir?

1968
01:44:32,074 --> 01:44:34,190
That's right, CQD, the distress call.

1969
01:44:34,674 --> 01:44:35,993
That's our position.

1970
01:44:41,195 --> 01:44:43,663
Tell whoever responds that we're 
going down by the head ...

1971
01:44:43,755 --> 01:44:45,632
and need immediate assistance.

1972
01:44:54,156 --> 01:44:55,350
Blimey.

1973
01:45:05,357 --> 01:45:06,676
Keep lowering!

1974
01:45:12,678 --> 01:45:16,273
Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!

1975
01:45:21,239 --> 01:45:24,390
Uncover this boat!
Uncover all the boats aft!

1976
01:45:24,479 --> 01:45:26,151
Release those ties!

1977
01:45:26,359 --> 01:45:29,112
Roll back that cover! Smartly now!

1978
01:45:29,639 --> 01:45:31,278
Mr. Wilde, where are the passengers?

1979
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:34,636
They've all gone back inside.
Too damn cold and noisy for them.

1980
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,755
You there!

1981
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:38,631
Get down here 
and help with these lines!

1982
01:45:52,562 --> 01:45:54,393
Care for a drink, sir?

1983
01:45:55,482 --> 01:45:56,756
Please put your lifebelts on.

1984
01:45:56,842 --> 01:45:58,514
Sonny, what's doing?

1985
01:45:58,642 --> 01:46:01,440
You got us all trussed up here
and now we're cooling our heels.

1986
01:46:01,522 --> 01:46:03,434
Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.

1987
01:46:04,283 --> 01:46:07,036
I don't think anybody knows
what the hell's going on around here.

1988
01:46:07,123 --> 01:46:09,876
It's just the goddamned English,
doing everything by the book.

1989
01:46:09,963 --> 01:46:12,682
There's no need 
for language, Mr. Hockley.

1990
01:46:12,923 --> 01:46:15,199
Go back and turn the heaters on
in our rooms.

1991
01:46:15,284 --> 01:46:17,081
I'd like a cup of tea when I return.

1992
01:46:17,164 --> 01:46:18,961
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

1993
01:46:28,165 --> 01:46:29,644
Mr. Andrews ...

1994
01:46:31,085 --> 01:46:33,997
I saw the iceberg.
And I see it in your eyes.

1995
01:46:34,365 --> 01:46:35,765
Please tell me the truth.

1996
01:46:44,006 --> 01:46:45,679
The ship will sink.

1997
01:46:47,327 --> 01:46:48,919
- You're certain?
- Yes.

1998
01:46:49,207 --> 01:46:50,879
In an hour or so ...

1999
01:46:51,647 --> 01:46:54,719
all this will be
at the bottom of the Atlantic.

2000
01:46:55,407 --> 01:46:56,443
What?

2001
01:46:56,528 --> 01:46:58,484
Please, tell only who you must.

2002
01:46:58,568 --> 01:47:00,718
I don't want to be 
responsible for a panic.

2003
01:47:00,888 --> 01:47:03,448
And get to a boat. 
Quickly. Don't wait.

2004
01:47:04,488 --> 01:47:07,322
You remember
what I told you about the boats?

2005
01:47:09,649 --> 01:47:10,684
Yes.

2006
01:47:12,569 --> 01:47:14,002
I understand.

2007
01:47:18,170 --> 01:47:20,479
Yes, madam, 
please put it on immediately.

2008
01:47:21,690 --> 01:47:23,169
Over here, son.

2009
01:47:24,010 --> 01:47:26,399
Sir, they need you up
at the second-class purser's office.

2010
01:47:26,490 --> 01:47:29,369
- There's a big mob up there.
- Go on. I'll keep an eye on him.

2011
01:47:29,891 --> 01:47:31,244
Aye. Right.

2012
01:47:44,612 --> 01:47:45,681
Sir!

2013
01:47:45,772 --> 01:47:48,127
Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.

2014
01:47:48,212 --> 01:47:50,089
Full steam for them, sir.

2015
01:47:51,373 --> 01:47:52,931
She's the only one who's responding?

2016
01:47:53,013 --> 01:47:54,412
The only one close, sir.

2017
01:47:54,493 --> 01:47:56,609
Says they can be here in 4 hours.

2018
01:47:57,133 --> 01:47:58,452
4 hours!

2019
01:48:03,574 --> 01:48:05,132
Thank you, Bride.

2020
01:48:09,454 --> 01:48:10,603
My God.

2021
01:48:19,855 --> 01:48:22,085
We are swung out and ready, sir.

2022
01:48:23,216 --> 01:48:26,413
Hadn't we better get the women
and children into the boats, sir?

2023
01:48:28,896 --> 01:48:30,011
Yes.

2024
01:48:30,096 --> 01:48:31,131
Sir?

2025
01:48:33,697 --> 01:48:36,894
Women and children first, yes.

2026
01:48:38,257 --> 01:48:39,485
Yes, sir.

2027
01:48:42,297 --> 01:48:45,335
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please!

2028
01:48:45,658 --> 01:48:47,888
Step this way, please. That's right.

2029
01:48:48,058 --> 01:48:50,367
Come towards me. Thank you.

2030
01:48:51,818 --> 01:48:52,887
Good.

2031
01:48:53,058 --> 01:48:56,938
For the time being, I shall 
require only women and children.

2032
01:48:57,219 --> 01:48:59,255
- Gentlemen, please.
- Right here.

2033
01:48:59,339 --> 01:49:02,968
All right, boys. Like the Captain said,
nice and cheery, so there's no panic.

2034
01:49:04,019 --> 01:49:05,578
Wedding Dance.

2035
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:15,655
Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.

2036
01:49:17,181 --> 01:49:18,819
Here, put your lifebelt on.

2037
01:49:18,901 --> 01:49:20,937
Yeah, come on. Put your lifebelt on.

2038
01:49:21,021 --> 01:49:22,579
Turn that around.

2039
01:49:23,621 --> 01:49:24,815
Please.

2040
01:49:26,781 --> 01:49:29,171
It isn't time to go up to the boats yet!

2041
01:49:29,542 --> 01:49:31,021
Please stay calm.

2042
01:49:31,102 --> 01:49:34,777
Make sure, everybody,
you've got your lifebelts on.

2043
01:49:34,862 --> 01:49:37,535
And, gentlemen, allow the women
and children through to the front.

2044
01:49:37,622 --> 01:49:39,932
- What are we doing, Mommy?
- We're just waiting, dear.

2045
01:49:40,023 --> 01:49:42,412
When they finish putting
first-class people in the boats ...

2046
01:49:42,503 --> 01:49:45,540
they will be starting with us
and we'll want to be all ready, won't we?

2047
01:49:45,623 --> 01:49:47,056
Everybody, not just right yet.

2048
01:49:47,143 --> 01:49:48,975
Don't push on the gates.
You won't get out any faster.

2049
01:49:49,064 --> 01:49:50,417
- Someone help.
- Go and get some help.

2050
01:49:50,504 --> 01:49:52,972
Lower it away, left and right together!

2051
01:49:55,144 --> 01:49:57,419
Both sides together! Steady!

2052
01:49:58,224 --> 01:49:59,419
Steady!

2053
01:50:02,465 --> 01:50:03,944
Stop!

2054
01:50:04,945 --> 01:50:06,617
Hold the left side!

2055
01:50:06,705 --> 01:50:08,900
Right side only!

2056
01:50:09,225 --> 01:50:11,535
Right side only. Hold the left side!

2057
01:50:12,906 --> 01:50:14,624
Lower away together!

2058
01:50:16,346 --> 01:50:17,779
Steady, lads!

2059
01:51:03,510 --> 01:51:06,469
You know, 
I do believe this ship may sink.

2060
01:51:08,951 --> 01:51:12,739
I've been asked to give you
this small token of our appreciation.

2061
01:51:15,632 --> 01:51:18,021
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

2062
01:51:24,712 --> 01:51:27,466
Come on, sister. You heard the man.
Into the boat.

2063
01:51:27,833 --> 01:51:29,630
Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen?

2064
01:51:29,713 --> 01:51:31,783
Only women at this time, sir.

2065
01:51:34,153 --> 01:51:36,952
Will the lifeboats be seated
according to class?

2066
01:51:38,354 --> 01:51:40,584
I hope they're not too crowded.

2067
01:51:41,674 --> 01:51:43,904
Oh, Mother, shut up!

2068
01:51:44,394 --> 01:51:45,873
Don't you understand?

2069
01:51:45,954 --> 01:51:48,230
The water is freezing
and there aren't enough boats.

2070
01:51:48,315 --> 01:51:49,953
Not enough by half.

2071
01:51:50,315 --> 01:51:52,545
Half the people on this ship
are going to die.

2072
01:51:52,835 --> 01:51:54,553
Not the better half.

2073
01:51:56,235 --> 01:52:00,070
Come on, Ruth, get in the boat.
First-class seats are right up here.

2074
01:52:00,756 --> 01:52:02,792
You know, it's a pity
I didn't keep that drawing.

2075
01:52:02,876 --> 01:52:04,753
It'll be worth a lot more by morning.

2076
01:52:04,836 --> 01:52:07,794
Women and children
towards the front, please.

2077
01:52:07,876 --> 01:52:10,266
You unimaginable bastard.

2078
01:52:11,197 --> 01:52:13,836
Come on, Rose, darling.
There's plenty of room for you.

2079
01:52:13,917 --> 01:52:15,032
Right this way, miss.

2080
01:52:15,117 --> 01:52:16,516
Come on, Rose.

2081
01:52:16,597 --> 01:52:18,315
You're next, darling.

2082
01:52:18,477 --> 01:52:20,389
Come into the boat, Rose.

2083
01:52:21,518 --> 01:52:22,587
Come.

2084
01:52:23,038 --> 01:52:24,107
Rose?

2085
01:52:25,158 --> 01:52:26,796
Get into the boat.

2086
01:52:27,118 --> 01:52:28,187
Rose?

2087
01:52:29,638 --> 01:52:31,197
Goodbye, Mother.

2088
01:52:32,799 --> 01:52:33,868
Rose?

2089
01:52:34,319 --> 01:52:36,708
- Rose, come back here.
- Where are you going?

2090
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:38,348
To him?

2091
01:52:38,479 --> 01:52:40,390
What, to be a whore to a gutter rat?

2092
01:52:40,479 --> 01:52:41,469
No, wait.

2093
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:44,199
I'd rather be his whore 
than your wife.

2094
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:48,189
No!

2095
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:50,113
I said, no!

2096
01:52:51,801 --> 01:52:53,712
Rose, please stop!

2097
01:52:55,401 --> 01:52:56,959
- Lower away!
- No, stop!

2098
01:52:57,041 --> 01:52:58,679
- All together.
- No, wait!

2099
01:52:58,761 --> 01:53:00,080
Lower away!

2100
01:53:00,241 --> 01:53:01,356
Rose!

2101
01:53:07,522 --> 01:53:08,591
Help!

2102
01:53:09,322 --> 01:53:11,313
Can anybody hear me?

2103
01:53:12,442 --> 01:53:14,320
Hello! Help me!

2104
01:53:24,124 --> 01:53:25,443
Mr. Andrews!

2105
01:53:28,724 --> 01:53:31,284
- Steward, check the starboard corridor.
- Yes, Mr. Andrews.

2106
01:53:31,364 --> 01:53:34,162
Madam, please, put on a lifebelt.
Get to the boat deck immediately.

2107
01:53:34,244 --> 01:53:36,805
Lucy, for God's sake, put on 
a lifebelt and set a good example.

2108
01:53:36,885 --> 01:53:38,113
Yes, sir.

2109
01:53:38,565 --> 01:53:40,760
- Anyone in here?
- Mr. Andrews?

2110
01:53:41,045 --> 01:53:42,080
Thank God.

2111
01:53:42,165 --> 01:53:44,725
Where would the master-at-arms
take someone under arrest?

2112
01:53:45,045 --> 01:53:47,480
- You have to get to a boat right away.
- No!

2113
01:53:47,566 --> 01:53:49,796
I'm doing this with or 
without your help, sir.

2114
01:53:49,886 --> 01:53:51,842
But without will take longer.

2115
01:53:53,126 --> 01:53:55,924
Take the elevator to the very bottom.
Go to the left.

2116
01:53:56,007 --> 01:53:59,556
Down the crewmen's passage, then 
go right and left again at the stairs.

2117
01:53:59,647 --> 01:54:01,080
You'll come to a long corridor.

2118
01:54:05,167 --> 01:54:06,806
This could be bad.

2119
01:54:10,928 --> 01:54:12,122
Oh, shit!

2120
01:54:18,729 --> 01:54:20,481
Excuse me. Thank you.

2121
01:54:21,849 --> 01:54:24,079
- I do not care what you think, sir.
- Lifts are closed.

2122
01:54:24,169 --> 01:54:26,922
I'm sorry, miss, 
but the lifts are closed.

2123
01:54:27,889 --> 01:54:31,360
I'm through being polite, 
God damn it! Now, take me down!

2124
01:54:33,050 --> 01:54:34,165
"E" deck.

2125
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:38,804
Come on.

2126
01:54:57,612 --> 01:54:59,250
- I'm going back up.
- No.

2127
01:55:04,733 --> 01:55:08,043
Come back! I'm going back up!

2128
01:55:16,374 --> 01:55:17,807
Crew passage.

2129
01:55:39,936 --> 01:55:41,051
Jack!

2130
01:55:53,377 --> 01:55:54,413
Rose!

2131
01:55:55,418 --> 01:55:56,407
Jack!

2132
01:55:56,498 --> 01:55:58,090
Rose, I'm in here!

2133
01:55:59,418 --> 01:56:00,407
Jack!

2134
01:56:01,418 --> 01:56:02,453
- Jack!
- Rose!

2135
01:56:02,538 --> 01:56:05,099
Jack! Jack, I'm sorry.

2136
01:56:05,659 --> 01:56:07,729
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

2137
01:56:08,739 --> 01:56:12,254
- That guy, Lovejoy, put it in my pocket.
- I know. I know.

2138
01:56:12,339 --> 01:56:13,488
Listen, Rose ...

2139
01:56:13,579 --> 01:56:15,615
you're gonna have to find 
a spare key, all right?

2140
01:56:15,699 --> 01:56:17,691
Look in that cabinet right there.

2141
01:56:18,020 --> 01:56:20,250
It's a little silver one, Rose.

2142
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:22,129
Silver.

2143
01:56:22,740 --> 01:56:24,696
These are all brass ones!

2144
01:56:24,940 --> 01:56:26,772
Check right here, Rose.

2145
01:56:30,701 --> 01:56:31,895
Rose ...

2146
01:56:33,061 --> 01:56:35,131
how'd you find out I didn't do it?

2147
01:56:35,301 --> 01:56:38,021
I didn't. 
I just realized I already knew.

2148
01:56:40,542 --> 01:56:41,975
Keep looking.

2149
01:56:50,463 --> 01:56:52,897
No key. There's no key!

2150
01:56:52,983 --> 01:56:54,018
All right, Rose, listen.

2151
01:56:54,103 --> 01:56:56,094
You're gonna have to go 
find some help.

2152
01:56:56,583 --> 01:56:58,096
It'll be all right.

2153
01:57:02,264 --> 01:57:03,936
I'll be right back.

2154
01:57:11,105 --> 01:57:12,823
I'll just wait here!

2155
01:57:25,306 --> 01:57:27,376
Hello? Is there anyone here?

2156
01:57:27,786 --> 01:57:28,901
Hello?

2157
01:57:29,706 --> 01:57:31,777
Is there anybody down here?

2158
01:57:32,427 --> 01:57:34,145
We need help! Hello?

2159
01:57:35,907 --> 01:57:37,101
Damn it.

2160
01:57:42,828 --> 01:57:45,262
Can anybody hear me, please? Hello?

2161
01:57:48,508 --> 01:57:49,736
Oh, thank God.

2162
01:57:49,868 --> 01:57:52,986
Wait, I need your help.
There's a man back here.

2163
01:57:53,309 --> 01:57:54,298
Wait!

2164
01:57:58,309 --> 01:57:59,458
Hello?

2165
01:58:24,391 --> 01:58:25,541
Hello?

2166
01:58:26,352 --> 01:58:27,785
Miss, you shouldn't be here now.

2167
01:58:27,872 --> 01:58:30,306
- I need your help.
- We'll get you topside. This way, quickly.

2168
01:58:30,392 --> 01:58:31,791
There's a man down here. He's trapped.

2169
01:58:31,872 --> 01:58:34,147
- This way. There is no need to panic.
- Please!

2170
01:58:34,232 --> 01:58:36,906
No, I'm not panicking!
You're going the wrong way!

2171
01:58:37,193 --> 01:58:38,911
Let go of me! Listen!

2172
01:58:44,033 --> 01:58:45,625
The hell with you.

2173
01:59:21,557 --> 01:59:22,910
Oh, my God.

2174
02:00:09,361 --> 02:00:10,430
Jack!

2175
02:00:10,921 --> 02:00:11,990
Rose!

2176
02:00:13,082 --> 02:00:14,561
Will this work?

2177
02:00:15,482 --> 02:00:17,712
I guess we'll find out. Come on.

2178
02:00:21,082 --> 02:00:22,151
Wait.

2179
02:00:22,442 --> 02:00:24,399
Try a couple 
of practice swings over there.

2180
02:00:30,123 --> 02:00:33,832
Good. Now try to hit the same 
mark again, Rose. You can do it.

2181
02:00:39,444 --> 02:00:41,196
Okay. That's enough practice.

2182
02:00:41,524 --> 02:00:43,116
Come on, Rose. You can do it.

2183
02:00:43,924 --> 02:00:46,962
Listen, just hit it really hard
and really fast.

2184
02:00:48,885 --> 02:00:50,238
Come on. Wait.

2185
02:00:50,365 --> 02:00:51,957
Open your hands up a little more.

2186
02:00:52,045 --> 02:00:53,114
- Good.
- Like that?

2187
02:00:53,205 --> 02:00:54,354
Right.

2188
02:00:54,605 --> 02:00:56,562
Listen, Rose, I trust you.

2189
02:01:01,366 --> 02:01:02,355
Go.

2190
02:01:08,167 --> 02:01:09,316
You did it!

2191
02:01:09,687 --> 02:01:11,245
Come on, let's go.

2192
02:01:11,367 --> 02:01:13,198
Oh, shit, this is cold!

2193
02:01:21,088 --> 02:01:22,806
This is the way out.

2194
02:01:23,008 --> 02:01:25,476
We have to find another way. 
Come on.

2195
02:01:39,050 --> 02:01:41,484
Now there's something
you don't see every day.

2196
02:02:02,771 --> 02:02:06,047
What's this luggage doing here?
Get rid of it. We need the room.

2197
02:02:06,131 --> 02:02:07,689
Get rid of that! Out!

2198
02:02:08,091 --> 02:02:11,129
Come. Time for her to go, sir. 
Step back.

2199
02:02:11,212 --> 02:02:13,362
- Keep calm. Sit down.
- No.

2200
02:02:13,652 --> 02:02:16,007
- No!
- Make more room.

2201
02:02:17,052 --> 02:02:18,724
That's right. Look sharp.

2202
02:02:19,612 --> 02:02:20,761
Lovejoy.

2203
02:02:20,852 --> 02:02:22,969
She's not on the starboard side, either.

2204
02:02:23,253 --> 02:02:24,402
We're running out of time.

2205
02:02:24,493 --> 02:02:27,530
This strutting martinet
isn't letting any men on at all.

2206
02:02:27,773 --> 02:02:30,241
There's one on the other side
letting men on.

2207
02:02:30,333 --> 02:02:31,766
Then that's our play.

2208
02:02:32,013 --> 02:02:34,653
We'll need some insurance first. 
Come on.

2209
02:02:34,734 --> 02:02:37,407
Come on, this way, please.
All the way down there.

2210
02:02:39,854 --> 02:02:40,923
Here!

2211
02:02:41,694 --> 02:02:43,890
What do you think you're doing?

2212
02:02:43,975 --> 02:02:46,045
You'll have to pay for that, you know.

2213
02:02:46,175 --> 02:02:48,894
- That's White Star Line property.
- Shut up!

2214
02:02:50,535 --> 02:02:54,006
Will you hold the boat a moment?
I just have to run back to my room ...

2215
02:02:54,096 --> 02:02:57,054
- Sit down.
- She's the last.

2216
02:02:57,136 --> 02:03:00,890
Mr. Lightoller, why are the boats 
being launched half-full?

2217
02:03:00,976 --> 02:03:02,648
- Not now, Mr. Andrews.
- There, look.

2218
02:03:02,776 --> 02:03:05,291
20 or so in a boat built for 65?

2219
02:03:05,377 --> 02:03:07,732
And I saw one boat with only 12. 12!

2220
02:03:07,817 --> 02:03:10,536
We weren't sure of the weight,
Mr. Andrews.

2221
02:03:10,617 --> 02:03:12,847
- These boats may buckle.
- Rubbish!

2222
02:03:13,057 --> 02:03:15,618
They were tested in Belfast
with the weight of 70 men.

2223
02:03:15,698 --> 02:03:18,656
Now fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller.
For God's sake, man!

2224
02:03:25,498 --> 02:03:28,297
Please, I need more 
women and children!

2225
02:03:32,939 --> 02:03:35,294
Get back in there! 
This is not an exit.

2226
02:03:35,379 --> 02:03:36,938
Get back in there.

2227
02:03:39,460 --> 02:03:43,135
You can't keep us locked in here
like animals. The ship's bloody sinking.

2228
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:45,256
Bring forward the women.

2229
02:03:45,340 --> 02:03:47,296
Unlock the gates.

2230
02:03:47,660 --> 02:03:49,299
Women only!

2231
02:04:02,222 --> 02:04:03,735
Lock the gates!

2232
02:04:11,823 --> 02:04:14,860
For God's sake, man, there are
women and children down here!

2233
02:04:14,983 --> 02:04:17,577
Let us up, so we can have a chance!

2234
02:04:17,863 --> 02:04:19,091
Get back!

2235
02:04:22,424 --> 02:04:23,698
- Jack.
- Tommy.

2236
02:04:23,784 --> 02:04:25,581
- Can we get out?
- It's hopeless that way.

2237
02:04:25,664 --> 02:04:27,700
Whatever we do, 
we've got to do it fast.

2238
02:04:27,824 --> 02:04:29,018
Jack!

2239
02:04:29,104 --> 02:04:30,332
Fabrizio.

2240
02:04:30,785 --> 02:04:32,059
The boats are all gone.

2241
02:04:32,145 --> 02:04:34,101
This whole place is flooding.
We've got to get out.

2242
02:04:34,185 --> 02:04:36,062
- There is niente this way.
- All right.

2243
02:04:36,185 --> 02:04:37,857
Let's go this way, 
all right? Come on.

2244
02:04:43,426 --> 02:04:45,701
- I make my own luck.
- So do I.

2245
02:04:53,547 --> 02:04:54,741
Come on!

2246
02:04:55,387 --> 02:04:56,900
No, come on, let's go this way.

2247
02:05:05,828 --> 02:05:07,102
This way.

2248
02:05:07,188 --> 02:05:11,306
Just go back to the main stairwell
and everything will be sorted out there.

2249
02:05:11,388 --> 02:05:12,377
The hell it will.

2250
02:05:12,708 --> 02:05:15,985
It will all get sorted out back there.
Go back to the main stairwell.

2251
02:05:16,109 --> 02:05:18,100
- Open the gate.
- Go back down the main stairwell.

2252
02:05:18,189 --> 02:05:19,178
Open the gate right now.

2253
02:05:19,269 --> 02:05:21,624
Go back down the main stairwell
like I told you!

2254
02:05:23,749 --> 02:05:26,344
God damn it! Son of a bitch!

2255
02:05:26,510 --> 02:05:27,784
Stop that!

2256
02:05:27,950 --> 02:05:29,702
Open the damn gate!

2257
02:05:32,270 --> 02:05:33,464
Fabri, Tommy, give me hand here.

2258
02:05:33,550 --> 02:05:35,701
- Move aside. Move aside!
- Pull!

2259
02:05:36,791 --> 02:05:37,860
Pull!

2260
02:05:38,591 --> 02:05:40,741
- Move aside.
- Put that down!

2261
02:05:40,831 --> 02:05:42,469
- Move aside!
- Put that down!

2262
02:05:42,551 --> 02:05:44,587
- One! Two!
- Stop that!

2263
02:05:44,791 --> 02:05:45,780
Three!

2264
02:05:47,912 --> 02:05:48,901
Again!

2265
02:05:51,032 --> 02:05:52,260
Let's go!

2266
02:05:54,192 --> 02:05:55,227
Let's go, Rose.

2267
02:05:55,312 --> 02:05:57,508
You can't go up there! 
You can't do this!

2268
02:06:03,913 --> 02:06:05,585
Keep order here!

2269
02:06:05,673 --> 02:06:07,790
Get back. Get back!

2270
02:06:12,674 --> 02:06:14,153
Hold on to her!

2271
02:06:15,114 --> 02:06:16,263
Pull her in.

2272
02:06:16,914 --> 02:06:18,985
Get back, I say ...

2273
02:06:19,195 --> 02:06:21,663
or I'll shoot you all like dogs!

2274
02:06:21,755 --> 02:06:22,983
Keep order here!

2275
02:06:24,555 --> 02:06:26,068
Keep order, I say.

2276
02:06:27,635 --> 02:06:29,513
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.

2277
02:06:33,756 --> 02:06:34,825
Right.

2278
02:06:34,916 --> 02:06:37,669
Is everybody all right? Nobody panic.

2279
02:06:43,757 --> 02:06:44,985
Stay back!

2280
02:06:45,677 --> 02:06:46,826
We're too late.

2281
02:06:46,917 --> 02:06:48,794
There are more boats down the front.

2282
02:06:48,877 --> 02:06:51,915
Stay with this one. Murdoch.
He seems to be quite practical.

2283
02:06:53,838 --> 02:06:55,317
Stop lowering!

2284
02:06:56,438 --> 02:06:57,666
Stop lowering!

2285
02:06:57,998 --> 02:06:59,317
Cut the falls!

2286
02:07:05,999 --> 02:07:07,318
Sit down!

2287
02:07:08,359 --> 02:07:10,748
Stay back, you lot! Just stay back!

2288
02:07:10,959 --> 02:07:13,394
Stay back, the lot of you! 
Just stay back!

2289
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:18,480
It's starting to fall apart.
We don't have much time.

2290
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:21,114
Mr. Murdoch?

2291
02:07:21,240 --> 02:07:23,914
Mr. Hockley. You two, with me, now!

2292
02:07:24,241 --> 02:07:27,438
I'm a businessman, as you know,
I have a business proposition for you.

2293
02:07:34,842 --> 02:07:35,991
Come on, Rose.

2294
02:07:39,282 --> 02:07:41,034
The boats are gone!

2295
02:07:45,683 --> 02:07:47,275
Colonel, are there any boats 
on that side?

2296
02:07:47,363 --> 02:07:49,752
No, miss, but there are a couple 
of boats all the way forward.

2297
02:07:49,843 --> 02:07:51,401
This way, I'll lead you.

2298
02:07:57,404 --> 02:08:00,077
What's the use?
Nobody's listening to us anyway.

2299
02:08:00,604 --> 02:08:04,392
They don't listen to us at dinner, either.
Come on, let's play. Keep us warm.

2300
02:08:05,764 --> 02:08:06,880
Orpheus.

2301
02:08:11,645 --> 02:08:14,478
Music to drown by.
Now I know I'm in first class.

2302
02:08:19,526 --> 02:08:22,484
- Where is everyone?
- They're all still aft, sir.

2303
02:08:22,686 --> 02:08:24,165
Come on, madam, don't cry.

2304
02:08:24,886 --> 02:08:27,081
We have an understanding, 
then, Mr. Murdoch.

2305
02:08:37,767 --> 02:08:41,556
Will the men please hold back?
Hold back, I say!

2306
02:08:44,128 --> 02:08:47,677
Women and children only! Get back!

2307
02:08:48,128 --> 02:08:50,199
I said, step back, sir.
Come through, madam.

2308
02:08:50,289 --> 02:08:52,086
This way. Step back, sir!

2309
02:08:52,169 --> 02:08:53,158
Let the women —

2310
02:08:53,249 --> 02:08:55,285
You better check the other side. Go!

2311
02:09:02,810 --> 02:09:06,325
I found her, on the other side.
Waiting for a boat ...

2312
02:09:06,970 --> 02:09:08,119
with him.

2313
02:09:09,290 --> 02:09:11,930
- Any more women and children?
- They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.

2314
02:09:12,011 --> 02:09:13,524
Anyone else then?

2315
02:09:14,491 --> 02:09:15,844
- Hop on, sir.
- Anyone else?

2316
02:09:15,931 --> 02:09:17,762
Do hurry. Hurry along.

2317
02:09:20,971 --> 02:09:22,325
Stand by the falls.

2318
02:09:22,412 --> 02:09:24,209
God damn it all to hell.

2319
02:09:26,692 --> 02:09:27,727
Shit.

2320
02:09:27,812 --> 02:09:28,801
Fire!

2321
02:09:29,932 --> 02:09:32,128
Sir, you can't go through here.

2322
02:09:32,493 --> 02:09:34,290
Sir, you can't go through.

2323
02:09:36,053 --> 02:09:38,009
That's it. Splendid. Right.

2324
02:09:42,213 --> 02:09:43,567
Prepare to lower!

2325
02:09:45,814 --> 02:09:47,406
Ready on the left!

2326
02:09:53,254 --> 02:09:54,574
Take them down.

2327
02:09:59,415 --> 02:10:00,689
Keep it steady.

2328
02:10:03,135 --> 02:10:06,446
Both sides together.
Steady. Keep it steady.

2329
02:10:07,976 --> 02:10:10,046
- Give her to me.
- Daddy.

2330
02:10:10,336 --> 02:10:12,896
- It'll be fine, darling. Don't you worry.
- Take her.

2331
02:10:12,976 --> 02:10:14,694
Daddy, get in the boat.

2332
02:10:14,776 --> 02:10:18,087
It's goodbye for a little while.
Only for a little while.

2333
02:10:18,177 --> 02:10:19,815
There'll be another 
boat for the daddies ...

2334
02:10:19,897 --> 02:10:21,569
this boat's for the mommies
and the children.

2335
02:10:21,657 --> 02:10:24,410
You hold Mommy's hand
and be a good little girl.

2336
02:10:25,097 --> 02:10:26,292
I'm not going without you.

2337
02:10:26,378 --> 02:10:28,687
- No. You have to go, now.
- No, Jack.

2338
02:10:29,018 --> 02:10:30,576
Get in the boat, Rose.

2339
02:10:30,658 --> 02:10:31,647
No, Jack.

2340
02:10:31,738 --> 02:10:33,456
Yes. Get on the boat.

2341
02:10:33,658 --> 02:10:35,535
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.

2342
02:10:38,619 --> 02:10:41,258
My God. Look at you. 
You look a fright.

2343
02:10:41,779 --> 02:10:42,814
Here.

2344
02:10:44,419 --> 02:10:46,455
Put this on. Come on.

2345
02:10:51,780 --> 02:10:53,611
Go on. I'll get the next one.

2346
02:10:53,700 --> 02:10:55,577
No, not without you.

2347
02:10:55,660 --> 02:10:57,616
I'll be all right. 
Listen, I'll be fine.

2348
02:10:57,700 --> 02:10:59,737
I'm a survivor, all right?
Don't worry about me.

2349
02:10:59,821 --> 02:11:01,015
Now, go on. Get on.

2350
02:11:01,101 --> 02:11:03,740
I have an arrangement with an officer
on the other side of the ship.

2351
02:11:03,821 --> 02:11:06,210
Jack and I can get off safely. 
Both of us.

2352
02:11:07,661 --> 02:11:09,857
See? I got my own boat to catch.

2353
02:11:09,942 --> 02:11:12,502
- Go.
- Come on, hurry. They're almost full.

2354
02:11:13,782 --> 02:11:14,817
Step aboard, miss.

2355
02:11:14,902 --> 02:11:16,255
- Go.
- Come on, hurry.

2356
02:11:17,062 --> 02:11:19,098
- Step aboard, please.
- You're Daddy's good girl.

2357
02:11:19,182 --> 02:11:21,333
- Step lively!
- Keep back.

2358
02:11:21,463 --> 02:11:23,101
Keep back, I say.

2359
02:11:24,863 --> 02:11:26,581
Clear the rail, please.

2360
02:11:27,583 --> 02:11:28,857
Lower away!

2361
02:11:32,424 --> 02:11:33,652
Steady.

2362
02:11:36,464 --> 02:11:38,534
And lower away evenly, lads.

2363
02:11:39,264 --> 02:11:40,253
Easy.

2364
02:11:40,704 --> 02:11:41,933
Lower away.

2365
02:11:42,025 --> 02:11:43,743
You're a good liar.

2366
02:11:43,905 --> 02:11:45,133
Almost as good as you.

2367
02:11:45,225 --> 02:11:47,898
Easy, now. And lower away.

2368
02:11:50,185 --> 02:11:53,258
There's no ... 
There's no arrangement, is there?

2369
02:11:54,906 --> 02:11:56,419
No, there is.

2370
02:11:56,626 --> 02:11:58,776
Not that you'll benefit much from it.

2371
02:11:58,866 --> 02:12:00,060
And even away.

2372
02:12:00,466 --> 02:12:01,455
I always win, Jack.

2373
02:12:01,546 --> 02:12:03,344
And lower away evenly, lads.

2374
02:12:03,427 --> 02:12:04,496
One way or another.

2375
02:12:04,587 --> 02:12:07,260
Watch that trim. Trim that boat.

2376
02:12:08,347 --> 02:12:09,336
Easy.

2377
02:12:10,307 --> 02:12:11,581
Even, lads.

2378
02:12:12,187 --> 02:12:14,816
Keep going!

2379
02:13:00,512 --> 02:13:01,581
Rose!

2380
02:13:03,752 --> 02:13:05,151
- Stop her!
- Rose!

2381
02:13:05,472 --> 02:13:07,384
- What are you doing?
- Stop her!

2382
02:13:08,353 --> 02:13:09,388
No!

2383
02:13:26,954 --> 02:13:28,069
Rose!

2384
02:13:31,355 --> 02:13:34,028
You're so stupid! 
Why did you do that?

2385
02:13:34,435 --> 02:13:36,107
You're so stupid, Rose.

2386
02:13:37,835 --> 02:13:39,747
Why did you do that? Why?

2387
02:13:40,316 --> 02:13:42,193
You jump, I jump, right?

2388
02:13:44,276 --> 02:13:45,311
Right.

2389
02:13:47,356 --> 02:13:48,505
Oh, God.

2390
02:13:48,596 --> 02:13:50,986
I couldn't go. I couldn't go, Jack.

2391
02:13:51,557 --> 02:13:53,912
It's all right. 
We'll think of something.

2392
02:13:54,797 --> 02:13:56,833
At least I'm with you.

2393
02:14:09,918 --> 02:14:11,237
Come on! Move!

2394
02:14:12,239 --> 02:14:13,467
Come on!

2395
02:14:14,319 --> 02:14:15,911
Come on! Move!

2396
02:14:21,999 --> 02:14:23,149
Come on!

2397
02:14:30,680 --> 02:14:31,715
Move!

2398
02:14:37,641 --> 02:14:39,040
Come on, come on, Rose!

2399
02:14:41,361 --> 02:14:42,760
Rose, come on!

2400
02:14:45,442 --> 02:14:46,511
Move, Rose!

2401
02:14:49,522 --> 02:14:50,557
Go!

2402
02:15:00,483 --> 02:15:02,633
I hope you enjoy your time together!

2403
02:15:16,605 --> 02:15:18,402
What could possibly be funny?

2404
02:15:19,285 --> 02:15:21,435
I put the diamond in the coat.

2405
02:15:24,325 --> 02:15:26,316
And I put the coat on her!

2406
02:15:27,846 --> 02:15:29,040
Come on.

2407
02:15:47,367 --> 02:15:49,040
Dada!

2408
02:15:52,088 --> 02:15:53,487
We can't leave him.

2409
02:15:57,488 --> 02:15:58,921
All right, come on!

2410
02:16:00,609 --> 02:16:02,440
Dada!

2411
02:16:14,810 --> 02:16:15,879
Go back!

2412
02:16:26,411 --> 02:16:28,606
That's the wrong way! Come back!

2413
02:16:35,092 --> 02:16:36,081
Go!

2414
02:16:38,412 --> 02:16:39,447
Go!

2415
02:16:40,332 --> 02:16:41,685
Run, Rose!

2416
02:16:48,813 --> 02:16:49,802
Jack!

2417
02:16:53,013 --> 02:16:54,447
- Jack!
- Rose!

2418
02:17:06,735 --> 02:17:07,804
This way!

2419
02:17:16,816 --> 02:17:17,805
Come on!

2420
02:17:19,136 --> 02:17:20,455
Give me your hand!

2421
02:17:28,897 --> 02:17:30,216
Oh, God!

2422
02:17:34,537 --> 02:17:35,572
Help!

2423
02:17:41,098 --> 02:17:42,213
Help!

2424
02:17:44,138 --> 02:17:46,447
Wait, sir! Sir, 
open the gate, please!

2425
02:17:46,538 --> 02:17:48,928
- Please!
- Please, help us!

2426
02:17:49,179 --> 02:17:50,692
- Please!
- Please!

2427
02:17:51,899 --> 02:17:53,048
Bloody hell!

2428
02:17:56,299 --> 02:17:57,288
Hurry.

2429
02:17:58,700 --> 02:18:00,452
- Come on, come on!
- Come on!

2430
02:18:00,980 --> 02:18:02,129
Go, go!

2431
02:18:02,220 --> 02:18:03,289
Jesus.

2432
02:18:04,100 --> 02:18:05,419
- Please!
- Come on!

2433
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:06,729
Hurry!

2434
02:18:07,100 --> 02:18:08,135
Come on!

2435
02:18:13,261 --> 02:18:14,933
I'm sorry, I dropped the keys.

2436
02:18:15,661 --> 02:18:16,935
- Wait, please!
- Wait!

2437
02:18:18,221 --> 02:18:21,055
Don't leave! Please, send for help!

2438
02:18:38,743 --> 02:18:40,814
I got it! Which one is it, Rose?

2439
02:18:41,104 --> 02:18:42,981
The short one. Try the short one.

2440
02:18:43,944 --> 02:18:45,218
Hurry, Jack.

2441
02:18:48,304 --> 02:18:50,295
Oh, no! No, it won't go in.

2442
02:18:50,544 --> 02:18:51,773
Hurry, Jack.

2443
02:18:54,305 --> 02:18:56,296
It's stuck! It's stuck!

2444
02:18:57,105 --> 02:18:59,016
- Come on!
- Hurry, Jack!

2445
02:19:00,305 --> 02:19:01,784
Hurry, Jack!

2446
02:19:04,466 --> 02:19:06,741
I got it! Go, Rose!

2447
02:19:07,626 --> 02:19:09,059
Go!

2448
02:19:18,747 --> 02:19:20,021
Jack!

2449
02:19:21,987 --> 02:19:23,386
Come on!

2450
02:19:24,708 --> 02:19:25,982
Move, move.

2451
02:19:35,669 --> 02:19:38,706
- Get those oars in place.
- Get an oar under it.

2452
02:19:39,429 --> 02:19:41,624
Women and children only, damn you!

2453
02:19:42,429 --> 02:19:44,989
Hold it!

2454
02:19:55,230 --> 02:19:59,144
Get these davits cranked in!
Let's get the falls hooked up!

2455
02:20:07,952 --> 02:20:09,180
Stay back!

2456
02:20:10,992 --> 02:20:12,311
Mommy!

2457
02:20:12,912 --> 02:20:14,504
Stay back, sir!

2458
02:20:15,912 --> 02:20:17,551
Stay back, I say.

2459
02:20:18,993 --> 02:20:20,426
Keep going up!

2460
02:20:23,193 --> 02:20:24,751
Stop pushing!

2461
02:20:25,713 --> 02:20:27,704
Stay back!

2462
02:20:27,793 --> 02:20:30,467
Will you give us a chance to live,
you limey bastard?

2463
02:20:30,554 --> 02:20:33,273
I'll shoot any man who tries 
to get past me! Get back!

2464
02:20:33,354 --> 02:20:34,423
Bastard!

2465
02:20:34,514 --> 02:20:35,788
Get back!

2466
02:20:36,434 --> 02:20:38,345
We had a deal, damn it!

2467
02:20:40,675 --> 02:20:44,554
Your money can't save you anymore
than it can save me. Get back!

2468
02:20:45,755 --> 02:20:47,473
Women and children only!

2469
02:20:49,876 --> 02:20:51,150
Stop pushing!

2470
02:20:53,276 --> 02:20:54,550
No, Tommy!

2471
02:20:55,076 --> 02:20:56,828
No! No, Tommy!

2472
02:20:57,516 --> 02:20:58,744
Bastardo!

2473
02:21:15,678 --> 02:21:16,906
No, Will!

2474
02:21:23,399 --> 02:21:24,388
Now stand back, damn you!

2475
02:21:28,199 --> 02:21:30,508
Gently, hold it.

2476
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:42,152
I have a child!

2477
02:21:43,240 --> 02:21:44,833
Clear a path!

2478
02:21:44,921 --> 02:21:46,832
Please, I have a child.

2479
02:21:47,561 --> 02:21:50,029
Please, I'm all she has in the world.

2480
02:21:50,841 --> 02:21:51,876
Go on.

2481
02:21:52,241 --> 02:21:53,674
Step back!

2482
02:21:53,761 --> 02:21:54,751
Please!

2483
02:21:54,842 --> 02:21:56,798
Here. Give her to me.

2484
02:22:02,562 --> 02:22:04,280
There, there.

2485
02:22:08,083 --> 02:22:10,472
Wait! Mr. Andrews.

2486
02:22:12,963 --> 02:22:14,191
Oh, Rose.

2487
02:22:16,724 --> 02:22:18,954
Won't you even make a try for it?

2488
02:22:20,164 --> 02:22:23,918
I'm sorry that I didn't build you
a stronger ship, young Rose.

2489
02:22:26,524 --> 02:22:28,516
It's going fast. We have to move.

2490
02:22:28,605 --> 02:22:29,640
Wait.

2491
02:22:32,645 --> 02:22:34,476
Good luck to you, Rose.

2492
02:22:35,925 --> 02:22:37,199
And to you.

2493
02:22:49,087 --> 02:22:51,806
Mr. Guggenheim? These are for you.

2494
02:22:51,887 --> 02:22:54,401
No, thank you.
We are dressed in our best ...

2495
02:22:54,487 --> 02:22:57,081
and are prepared to go down
as gentlemen.

2496
02:22:57,847 --> 02:22:59,486
But we would like a brandy.

2497
02:23:00,208 --> 02:23:02,085
Get the falls over here now!

2498
02:23:02,808 --> 02:23:05,242
Make them taut. Then we'll right it!

2499
02:23:11,609 --> 02:23:14,601
Capitain, Capitain, 
where should I go? Please.

2500
02:23:20,410 --> 02:23:22,970
Captain. Sir.

2501
02:23:52,773 --> 02:23:54,650
Right. That's it, then.

2502
02:23:55,653 --> 02:23:57,689
Goodbye, Wally, good luck.

2503
02:23:58,013 --> 02:24:00,527
- Goodbye, Wallace.
- So long, old chap.

2504
02:25:11,460 --> 02:25:15,089
And so they lived happily 
together for 300 years ...

2505
02:25:16,180 --> 02:25:18,614
in the land of "Tir na nÓg" ...

2506
02:25:18,901 --> 02:25:21,210
land of eternal youth and beauty.

2507
02:25:55,664 --> 02:25:58,417
There's no time! Cut the falls!

2508
02:25:58,504 --> 02:26:00,859
Cut them if you have to!

2509
02:26:01,464 --> 02:26:03,695
I need a knife!

2510
02:26:05,225 --> 02:26:08,615
Cut the falls now! Cut them loose!

2511
02:26:19,426 --> 02:26:21,223
Cut those bloody falls!

2512
02:27:06,751 --> 02:27:10,426
Gentlemen, it has been a privilege
playing with you tonight.

2513
02:28:08,956 --> 02:28:10,993
We have to stay on the ship
as long as possible.

2514
02:28:11,077 --> 02:28:12,271
Come on.

2515
02:28:23,718 --> 02:28:25,629
This way. Hold the rail.

2516
02:28:27,438 --> 02:28:29,633
Come on, Rose. Jump.

2517
02:28:32,078 --> 02:28:33,228
Come on.

2518
02:29:05,322 --> 02:29:06,960
I got you. Jump!

2519
02:29:09,402 --> 02:29:11,120
I've got you, miss.

2520
02:29:11,562 --> 02:29:12,961
- Jack!
- What?

2521
02:29:14,762 --> 02:29:15,798
Back!

2522
02:29:44,725 --> 02:29:46,397
No, you'll swamp us!

2523
02:29:54,406 --> 02:29:55,680
Nobody panic.

2524
02:29:58,887 --> 02:30:01,959
Yea, though I walk through the 
valley of the shadow of death —

2525
02:30:02,047 --> 02:30:04,720
You want to walk a little faster
through that valley, there?

2526
02:30:52,692 --> 02:30:55,160
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us, sinners ...

2527
02:30:55,252 --> 02:30:57,561
now and at the hour 
of our death. Amen.

2528
02:30:57,652 --> 02:30:59,085
Hail Mary, full of grace ...

2529
02:30:59,172 --> 02:31:00,366
This way.

2530
02:31:10,973 --> 02:31:12,372
Come on!

2531
02:31:21,334 --> 02:31:23,564
And I saw a new heaven 
and a new Earth.

2532
02:31:23,654 --> 02:31:26,965
For the first heaven and the 
first Earth had passed away ...

2533
02:31:28,255 --> 02:31:30,246
and there was no more sea.

2534
02:31:35,856 --> 02:31:38,893
It'll be over soon. 
It'll all be over soon.

2535
02:31:44,576 --> 02:31:46,169
And he shall dwell with them ...

2536
02:31:46,257 --> 02:31:47,975
and they shall be his people ...

2537
02:31:48,057 --> 02:31:51,493
and God himself shall be with them
and be their God.

2538
02:31:52,617 --> 02:31:53,811
Jack ...

2539
02:31:54,617 --> 02:31:56,096
this is where we first met.

2540
02:32:03,178 --> 02:32:06,488
And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes ...

2541
02:32:06,578 --> 02:32:08,854
and there shall be no more death ...

2542
02:32:09,419 --> 02:32:11,933
neither shall there 
be sorrow or crying ...

2543
02:32:12,019 --> 02:32:14,487
neither shall there 
be any more pain ...

2544
02:32:14,859 --> 02:32:17,327
for the former world has passed away.

2545
02:32:31,621 --> 02:32:33,816
Bloody pull faster! And pull!

2546
02:32:56,223 --> 02:32:57,656
Hang on, Miss Trudy!

2547
02:33:31,906 --> 02:33:33,544
Hold on real tight.

2548
02:33:50,428 --> 02:33:51,827
God almighty!

2549
02:33:59,029 --> 02:34:01,384
Keep those breakers in! Keep them in!

2550
02:35:17,396 --> 02:35:18,954
We have to move!

2551
02:35:24,157 --> 02:35:26,034
Give me your hand, I'll pull you over.

2552
02:35:26,357 --> 02:35:28,348
Come on, give me your hand.

2553
02:35:30,597 --> 02:35:32,714
I've got you. I won't let go.

2554
02:35:32,798 --> 02:35:33,787
Come on, I've got you.

2555
02:35:44,879 --> 02:35:47,393
- What's happening, Jack?
- I don't know.

2556
02:35:56,560 --> 02:35:58,118
- Hold on!
- Jack!

2557
02:36:01,120 --> 02:36:03,270
Somebody help me, please!

2558
02:36:38,324 --> 02:36:39,643
This is it!

2559
02:36:51,245 --> 02:36:53,475
Oh, my God, Jack!

2560
02:36:54,605 --> 02:36:55,799
Hold on!

2561
02:37:10,327 --> 02:37:12,557
The ship is gonna suck us down.

2562
02:37:12,847 --> 02:37:14,439
Take a deep breath when I say.

2563
02:37:19,888 --> 02:37:22,243
Kick for the surface and keep kicking.

2564
02:37:22,328 --> 02:37:23,807
Do not let go of my hand.

2565
02:37:30,809 --> 02:37:33,277
We're going to make it, Rose. Trust me.

2566
02:37:33,369 --> 02:37:34,688
I trust you.

2567
02:37:39,168 --> 02:37:42,400
Ready? Now!

2568
02:38:17,692 --> 02:38:19,444
Jack!

2569
02:38:23,212 --> 02:38:24,566
- Rose!
- Jack!

2570
02:38:29,013 --> 02:38:30,002
Jack!

2571
02:38:49,855 --> 02:38:51,447
Jack!

2572
02:39:02,056 --> 02:39:03,569
Get off her!

2573
02:39:07,136 --> 02:39:08,286
- Rose!
- Jack!

2574
02:39:08,377 --> 02:39:10,607
Swim, Rose! I need you to swim!

2575
02:39:14,337 --> 02:39:15,770
Keep swimming.

2576
02:39:19,498 --> 02:39:21,728
- It's so cold.
- Swim, Rose!

2577
02:39:26,978 --> 02:39:28,697
Come on. Here.

2578
02:39:30,059 --> 02:39:32,209
Keep swimming. Come on.

2579
02:39:34,499 --> 02:39:36,091
Here, get on it.

2580
02:39:37,379 --> 02:39:38,812
Get on top.

2581
02:39:45,980 --> 02:39:47,413
Come on, Rose.

2582
02:39:56,421 --> 02:39:58,332
Stay on it. Stay on, Rose.

2583
02:40:18,983 --> 02:40:20,814
It'll be all right now.

2584
02:40:22,864 --> 02:40:24,582
You'll be all right now.

2585
02:40:31,544 --> 02:40:34,423
Return the boats!

2586
02:40:38,265 --> 02:40:40,654
The boats are coming 
back for us, Rose.

2587
02:40:40,945 --> 02:40:43,061
Hold on just a little bit longer.

2588
02:40:43,145 --> 02:40:45,706
They had to row away 
for the suction ...

2589
02:40:46,946 --> 02:40:49,141
but now they'll be coming back.

2590
02:40:50,746 --> 02:40:52,065
For God's sake!

2591
02:40:52,146 --> 02:40:55,139
Please help us!

2592
02:41:00,267 --> 02:41:01,985
You don't understand.

2593
02:41:02,667 --> 02:41:06,786
If we go back, they'll swamp the boat.
They'll pull us right down, I'm telling you.

2594
02:41:06,868 --> 02:41:09,223
Knock it off. You're scaring me.

2595
02:41:09,548 --> 02:41:12,142
Come on, girls, grab an oar. Let's go.

2596
02:41:12,228 --> 02:41:15,504
Are you out of your mind? We're in 
the middle of the North Atlantic.

2597
02:41:15,588 --> 02:41:18,865
Now, do you people want to live
or do you want to die?

2598
02:41:25,309 --> 02:41:27,540
I don't understand a one of you.

2599
02:41:29,230 --> 02:41:32,427
What's the matter with you?
It's your men out there!

2600
02:41:35,110 --> 02:41:36,748
There's plenty of room for more.

2601
02:41:36,830 --> 02:41:38,662
And there'll be one less on this boat.

2602
02:41:38,751 --> 02:41:41,470
If you don't shut 
that hole in your face!

2603
02:41:56,952 --> 02:41:58,908
Bring in your oars over there.

2604
02:41:58,992 --> 02:42:01,507
Tie these two boats together as well.

2605
02:42:05,193 --> 02:42:07,912
Now, make sure that's tied up
nice and tight.

2606
02:42:11,114 --> 02:42:13,503
Right, listen to me, men.
We have to go back.

2607
02:42:13,594 --> 02:42:17,109
I want to transfer all the women
from this boat into that boat right now.

2608
02:42:17,194 --> 02:42:18,513
As quick as you can, please.

2609
02:42:18,594 --> 02:42:21,063
Let's create some space over there.
Move forward and out.

2610
02:42:30,435 --> 02:42:32,108
It's getting quiet.

2611
02:42:34,396 --> 02:42:39,106
It's just going to take a couple of 
minutes to get the boats organized.

2612
02:42:42,597 --> 02:42:44,428
I don't know about you ...

2613
02:42:44,517 --> 02:42:48,271
but I intend to write
a strongly-worded letter ...

2614
02:42:48,357 --> 02:42:50,825
to the White Star Line about all this.

2615
02:42:57,718 --> 02:42:59,310
I love you, Jack.

2616
02:43:05,719 --> 02:43:07,311
Don't you do that.

2617
02:43:08,599 --> 02:43:10,715
Don't you say your goodbyes.

2618
02:43:11,159 --> 02:43:13,275
Not yet. Do you understand me?

2619
02:43:13,879 --> 02:43:15,233
I'm so cold.

2620
02:43:16,120 --> 02:43:17,553
Listen, Rose ...

2621
02:43:18,640 --> 02:43:20,517
you're gonna get out of here.

2622
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:22,998
You're gonna go on ...

2623
02:43:23,480 --> 02:43:26,075
and you're gonna make lots of babies.

2624
02:43:26,521 --> 02:43:28,637
And you're gonna watch them grow.

2625
02:43:29,881 --> 02:43:33,840
You're gonna die an old lady,
warm in her bed.

2626
02:43:36,041 --> 02:43:37,236
Not here.

2627
02:43:37,802 --> 02:43:39,281
Not this night.

2628
02:43:39,682 --> 02:43:42,116
Not like this. 
Do you understand me?

2629
02:43:44,962 --> 02:43:46,680
I can't feel my body.

2630
02:43:48,803 --> 02:43:52,591
Winning that ticket was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

2631
02:43:54,403 --> 02:43:56,121
It brought me to you.

2632
02:43:57,764 --> 02:43:59,994
And I'm thankful for that, Rose.

2633
02:44:00,684 --> 02:44:02,083
I'm thankful.

2634
02:44:04,124 --> 02:44:06,513
You must ...

2635
02:44:07,644 --> 02:44:09,203
do me this honor.

2636
02:44:12,245 --> 02:44:15,043
You must promise me that you'll survive.

2637
02:44:16,485 --> 02:44:18,794
That you won't give up ...

2638
02:44:20,086 --> 02:44:21,963
no matter what happens.

2639
02:44:24,406 --> 02:44:26,362
No matter how hopeless.

2640
02:44:29,967 --> 02:44:31,685
Promise me now, Rose.

2641
02:44:34,127 --> 02:44:36,436
And never let go of that promise.

2642
02:44:37,767 --> 02:44:39,041
I promise.

2643
02:44:41,288 --> 02:44:42,721
Never let go.

2644
02:44:45,528 --> 02:44:47,439
I'll never let go, Jack.

2645
02:44:50,248 --> 02:44:51,841
I'll never let go.

2646
02:45:15,011 --> 02:45:16,603
Right ahead, sir.

2647
02:45:19,571 --> 02:45:20,606
Oars!

2648
02:45:21,331 --> 02:45:23,128
Do you see any moving?

2649
02:45:24,012 --> 02:45:25,923
No, sir. None moving, sir.

2650
02:45:26,452 --> 02:45:27,771
Check them.

2651
02:45:28,092 --> 02:45:29,923
Bring that oar up here.

2652
02:45:35,733 --> 02:45:37,564
Check them. Make sure.

2653
02:45:37,933 --> 02:45:39,685
These are dead, sir.

2654
02:45:40,173 --> 02:45:42,448
Now give way. Ahead easy.

2655
02:45:49,174 --> 02:45:51,847
Careful with your oars. 
Don't hit them.

2656
02:45:54,654 --> 02:45:56,885
Is there anyone alive out there?

2657
02:45:58,415 --> 02:46:00,326
Can anyone hear me?

2658
02:46:02,215 --> 02:46:04,445
Is there anyone alive out there?

2659
02:46:11,176 --> 02:46:12,655
We waited too long.

2660
02:46:16,496 --> 02:46:18,852
Keep checking them! Keep looking!

2661
02:46:20,217 --> 02:46:22,447
Is there anyone alive out there?

2662
02:46:25,937 --> 02:46:27,609
Can anyone hear me?

Jack?

2669
02:47:49,185 --> 02:47:50,664
There's a boat.

2670
02:47:51,185 --> 02:47:52,220
Jack?

2671
02:48:16,508 --> 02:48:18,226
There's a boat, Jack.

2672
02:49:00,192 --> 02:49:01,466
Come back.

2673
02:49:10,873 --> 02:49:12,147
Come back!

2674
02:49:16,793 --> 02:49:18,431
Hello!

2675
02:49:19,873 --> 02:49:21,705
Can anyone hear me?

2676
02:49:22,634 --> 02:49:24,590
There's nothing here, sir.

2677
02:49:26,394 --> 02:49:27,668
Come back.

2678
02:49:37,875 --> 02:49:40,628
I'll never let go. I promise.

2679
02:50:22,559 --> 02:50:23,878
Come about!

2680
02:50:44,521 --> 02:50:47,719
1,500 people went into the sea ...

2681
02:50:48,242 --> 02:50:51,075
when Titanic sank from under us.

2682
02:50:53,122 --> 02:50:55,875
There were 20 boats floating nearby ...

2683
02:50:57,202 --> 02:50:59,080
and only one came back.

2684
02:51:01,283 --> 02:51:02,272
One.

2685
02:51:04,003 --> 02:51:06,437
6 were saved from the water ...

2686
02:51:06,803 --> 02:51:08,362
myself included.

2687
02:51:09,764 --> 02:51:14,042
6 out of 1,500.

2688
02:51:17,204 --> 02:51:21,357
Afterward, 
the 700 people in the boats ...

2689
02:51:21,725 --> 02:51:24,034
had nothing to do but wait.

2690
02:51:25,805 --> 02:51:28,797
Wait to die, wait to live.

2691
02:51:30,286 --> 02:51:32,356
Wait for an absolution ...

2692
02:51:32,846 --> 02:51:34,757
that would never come.

2693
02:52:36,372 --> 02:52:38,647
Sir, I don't think you'll find
any of your people down here.

2694
02:52:38,732 --> 02:52:40,324
It's all steerage.

2695
02:52:45,213 --> 02:52:48,046
His hair is reddish brown,
and a white beard.

2696
02:52:48,173 --> 02:52:50,971
- Isn't there another passenger list?
- There's no other list.

2697
02:52:51,053 --> 02:52:54,363
- Perhaps he's on another ship.
- We're doing all we can.

2698
02:53:17,096 --> 02:53:19,610
That's the last time I ever saw him.

2699
02:53:19,816 --> 02:53:22,888
He married, of course,
and inherited his millions.

2700
02:53:24,056 --> 02:53:27,173
But the crash of '29 
hit his interests hard.

2701
02:53:27,576 --> 02:53:30,137
And he put a pistol 
in his mouth that year.

2702
02:53:30,457 --> 02:53:31,856
Or so I read.

2703
02:53:44,458 --> 02:53:46,574
Can I take your name, please, love?

2704
02:53:48,858 --> 02:53:49,974
Dawson.

2705
02:53:52,219 --> 02:53:53,572
Rose Dawson.

2706
02:53:54,659 --> 02:53:55,933
Thank you.

2707
02:54:02,620 --> 02:54:06,454
We never found anything on Jack.
There's no record of him at all.

2708
02:54:07,420 --> 02:54:09,297
No, there wouldn't be, would there?

2709
02:54:09,940 --> 02:54:14,457
And I've never spoken of him 
until now. Not to anyone.

2710
02:54:15,261 --> 02:54:17,331
Not even your grandfather.

2711
02:54:17,621 --> 02:54:20,897
A woman's heart
is a deep ocean of secrets.

2712
02:54:22,222 --> 02:54:25,498
But now you know there was a 
man named Jack Dawson ...

2713
02:54:25,982 --> 02:54:27,779
and that he saved me ...

2714
02:54:28,262 --> 02:54:31,015
in every way 
that a person can be saved.

2715
02:54:33,263 --> 02:54:35,652
I don't even have a picture of him.

2716
02:54:38,223 --> 02:54:41,932
He exists now only in my memory.

2717
02:54:46,784 --> 02:54:49,503
Keldysh, Mir-2 on our way 
to the surface.

2718
02:55:05,986 --> 02:55:08,898
I was saving this
for when I found the diamond.

2719
02:55:17,667 --> 02:55:18,941
I'm sorry.

2720
02:55:21,627 --> 02:55:22,946
3 years.

2721
02:55:23,587 --> 02:55:26,227
I've thought of nothing 
except Titanic.

2722
02:55:26,828 --> 02:55:28,546
But I never got it.

2723
02:55:31,523 --> 02:55:33,115
I never let it in.
