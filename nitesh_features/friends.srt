Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.

155
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,316
Okay, did you see that?
With the inappropriate, and the pinching?

156
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,651
Actually, I did.

157
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,404
So now do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

158
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,450
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
She knows about us.

159
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,702
Are you serious?

160
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:41,204
Phoebe knows,
and she's just trying to freak us out.

161
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,790
That's the only explanation for it.

162
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:51,381
Okay, but what about my pinchable butt
and my bulging biceps?

163
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,133
She knows.

164
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,015
Joey.

165
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,725
Yeah?

166
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,312
Phoebe knows about us.

167
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,272
Well, I didn't tell them.

168
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,358
Them? Who's "them"?

169
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:14,112
Uh, Phoebe and Joey.

Joey.

And Rachel.

172
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,995
Look, I would have told you,
but they made me promise not to tell.

173
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,747
- Oh, man.
- I'm sorry.

174
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,665
But, hey, it's over now, right?

175
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,751
Because you can tell them
you know they know...

176
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,337
...and I can go back to knowing
absolutely nothing.

177
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,967
- Unless...
- No, not "unless." This must end now.

178
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,846
Oh, man, they think they are so slick
messing with us.

179
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:43,224
But they don't know
that we know that they know.

180
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,603
- So...
- Ah, yes.

Oh, Ross, honey,
you gotta stop torturing yourself.

184
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,239
Why don't you just find
another apartment?

185
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,326
I've already looked at
like a thousand apartments this month.

186
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,870
None of them even compares
to that one.

You know what you should do?

188
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:10,126
You should find out what his hobbies are
and then use that to bond with him.

189
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,295
Yeah. Like if I wanted something
from Joey...

190
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,675
...I would strike up a conversation
about, say, um, sandwiches...

191
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,762
...or, uh, my underwear.

I'm listening.

That is a great idea.

we've been watching him for five years.

So that gives me back my edge. Ha, ha.

197
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,031
Let's see now. He had the trampoline.

198
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,534
- But he broke that.
- Well, he had gravity boots.

199
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,036
Yeah, he broke those too.

200
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,415
So he likes to break stuff.

Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben,
but I will figure something out.

202
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,923
Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?

203
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,843
I wouldn't bring that up.
It would probably just bum him out.

204
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,929
Poor cat never saw that big butt coming.

Huh?

Well, you know that thing you said before?
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.

Yeah. Listen, Joey won't be here tonight.

Okay, bye.
